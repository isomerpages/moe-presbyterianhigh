# **National Digital Literacy Programme**

Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in  jobs, workplaces and society.

The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready. 


**The NDLP aims to equip our students with Digital Literacies.** 

Digital Literacies will better enable our students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age. We hope to do this by applying the four mutually reinforcing components in the **'Find, Think, Apply and Create’ framework'**.

Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will **own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD)** by Term 3, 2021.

The device will be used to facilitate an environment that **encourages personalised learning.**
