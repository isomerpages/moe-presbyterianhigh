*   Students taking HMTL need not take MTL.
*   Students taking HCL report to their HCL classes during mother tongue periods.  Secondary 1 HCL students will have extended curriculum of 50 minutes on one of the weekdays.

*   Students who obtain B3 or below for O-level MTL are strongly encouraged to re-sit for their GCE O-level MTL exam in June the following year.  As students are not allowed to sit for MTL and HMTL O-level exam in the same academic year, these students will NOT be offered HMTL in Secondary 4.
