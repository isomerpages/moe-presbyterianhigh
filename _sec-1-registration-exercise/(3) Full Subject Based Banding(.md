<h3>Full Subject-Based Banding</h3>
<p><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) Matters</strong>
<br>At PHS, our Lower Secondary students are grouped in mixed form classes,
comprising students from different Posting Groups. Mixed form classes present
more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking
different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.
<br>
<br>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a
common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would
allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together
in these subjects.</p>
<p>These subjects are:</p>
<p>• Art</p>
<p>• Character and Citizenship Education</p>
<p>• Design and Technology</p>
<p>• Food and Consumer Education</p>
<p>• Music</p>
<p>• Physical Education
<br>
<br>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different
learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.
<br>
<br>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will
be taught at G1, G2 or G3 Level, based on the students’ PSLE AL Score for
each subject. Students will attend the lessons based on the level they
are eligible for.</p>
<p>Should the student be eligible to offer a subject at a more demanding
level, a letter of offer would be sent via Parents Gateway (PG). Please
exercise your option(s) <strong><u>by 24th Dec 2025 via PG</u></strong>.</p>
