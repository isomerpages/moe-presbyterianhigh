<h3>Personal Learning Device (PLD) Initiative</h3>
<p><strong><u>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to help students <strong>strengthen their digital literacy and</strong>  <strong>acquire digital skills </strong>needed
to navigate an increasingly digitalised world. Under the NDLP, every secondary
school student will <strong>own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD)</strong>.
Students may use funds from their Edusave Account&nbsp;to pay for the PLD.</p>
<p><strong><u>Personal Learning Device (PLD)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school-prescribed PLD is the <strong>Apple&nbsp;iPad 11 inch (A16)</strong>.
All student PLDs will be installed with the <strong>MOE Device Management Application (DMA)</strong> solution
to support safe and responsible use.</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians may choose <strong>one of the following two options</strong> for
their child’s PLD:</p>
<p><strong><u>Option 1: MOE iPad Bundle (recommended)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school has made arrangements for parents to purchase the PLD from <strong>AsiaPac Distribution Pte. Ltd.</strong>,
the MOE-appointed vendor.</p>

<p><strong>Funding Support for Singapore Citizen (SC) Students</strong>
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Payment can be made using your child’s/ward’s Edusave account</strong>,
after setting aside provision for payment of miscellaneous fees.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure the affordability of devices, MOE
has provided Edusave top-ups from 2020 to 2023 and in 2025 to all eligible
Singapore Citizen students.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Most SC students will have sufficient Edusave funds.</strong>
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If<strong> </strong>Edusave funds are insufficient,
please ensure sufficient&nbsp;funds in your GIRO-linked bank account for
deduction<strong> on 13 Feb 2026</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>For Singapore Citizen (SC) Students</strong>
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE FAS: $0 out-of-pocket. Subsidies are automatically
provided.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School-based FAS: Up to $50 out-of-pocket&nbsp;after
subsidies.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsides are <strong>not applicable</strong> for
non-FAS SC students, whose Gross Monthly Household income (GMH) exceeds
$5,500 or Per Capita Income (PCI) exceeds $1,375. Parents/Guardians can
use their child’s/ward’s Edusave or cash to defray the device bundle cost.</p>
<p><strong>For Non-SC Students</strong>
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permanent Residents and International students
may approach the school for assistance if GMH is below $5,500 or PCI is
below $1,375.</p>
<p><strong><u>Option 2: Bring existing iPad for DMA Installation</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians who do not opt for the MOE iPad bundle must ensure that
the existing iPad meet <strong>all </strong>the following requirements:</p>
