</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the venue of HMTL
lessons?</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does my child need to take
both MTL and HMTL? Does my child need to stay back after school for HMTL
lessons?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students taking HMTL need not take MTL.</p>
</li>
<li>

the weekdays.</p>

</ul>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does my child need to sit
for his/her CL/ ML/ TL examination at the end of Secondary 4, if he/she
is taking HMTL?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>No. Students who offer HMTL will sit for the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary
Education Certificate (SEC) G3 MTL examination at the end of Secondary
3.&nbsp; They will only sit for the HMTL examination at the Singapore-Cambridge
Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) Examination at the end of Secondary
4. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who are unable to cope with HMTL learning at the end of Secondary
3 may choose to offer G3 MTL instead of HMTL in Secondary 4 and re-take
the G3 MTL examination in the following year.&nbsp; As students are not
allowed to sit for the MTL and HMTL examinations in the same academic year,
these students will NOT be offered HMTL in Secondary 4.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My child is not offered HMTL.
Can my child appeal to offer HMTL?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MOE has identified a list of students who are eligible* to take HMTL (HCL/HML/HTL).&nbsp;
The school will admit the Secondary 1 students based on this list.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of Secondary 1 and Secondary 2, students who have done well
in their MTL and their overall results, and who have met the school’s criteria,
will be offered HMTL by the school.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 2026 onwards, Secondary 1 students who attain AL1/ AL2 in MTL or
a distinction/ merit in HMTL in the PSLE are eligible to take HMTL.</p>
</li>
