<h3>Principal's Welcome Message</h3>
<p>Dear Secondary 1 Students,</p>
<p>Welcome to Presbyterian High School! We are delighted that you are joining
our school community and hope you are as happy as we are to begin this
new chapter together.</p>
<p>Starting secondary school is a big step - it's normal to feel both excited
and a little nervous. But here's something important to remember: you are
not alone. Presbyterian High School is a mission school, and we believe
that you have been placed here by God. You are now part of a caring community
where every student is valued, supported and encouraged to discover their
potential. This wonderful school culture is represented by <strong>TEAM</strong> PHS,
where we practice <strong>T</strong>eamwork, <strong>E</strong>xcellence, <strong>A</strong>ffirmation
and <strong>M</strong>ission-mindedness. I’m confident you will soon embrace
and embody this culture.
<br>
<br>In the coming year, you will have many opportunities to discover new talents,
explore your interests, and develop friendships that will make your school
life memorable. As a mission school, character development is at the heart
of what we do. You will experience daily devotions during morning assembly
and a chapel service once a week—moments that provide time for reflection
and help build the values that will guide you in your secondary school
journey. Our teachers and student leaders are here every step of the way.
<br>
<br>I encourage you to embrace challenges with courage, be kind to your peers,
and make the most of the exciting experiences that lie ahead. Secondary
school is a journey of discovery and growth — both inside and outside the
classroom — and I look forward to seeing you thrive and shine in the years
to come.
<br>
<br>On this website, you will find important information about starting Secondary
1 well. Please go through it with your parents or guardians, as it will
help you feel ready and confident for the start of school. More information
will be sent via Parents’ Gateway shortly.
<br>Once again, welcome to Presbyterian High School. Let's make this a wonderful
year together!</p>
<p>Your Principal,
<br>Ms Loh Sein Ling</p>
