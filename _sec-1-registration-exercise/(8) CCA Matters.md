<p><strong>Co-Curriculum Complements the Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A holistic education provides students with both <strong>breadth and depth</strong>—equipping
them with a strong foundation for <strong>lifelong learning</strong>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCAs play a critical role in complementing the formal
curriculum by translating learning into <strong>authentic, lived experiences</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Every student will have a CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCAs provide students with a platform to discover
their interests and talents. They aim to fuel in students a lifelong love
for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This will
enable the students to lead a balanced life in adulthood.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge,
skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of
the CCA. CCAs also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core
values, social and emotional competencies and 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All CCAs emphasise social interaction by providing
a common space for the fostering of friendships and social integration
amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through active participation in
a CCA, students also develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.</p>
<p><strong>Through CCAs, PresHighians can:</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop as Passionate Learners</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through breadth of experiences
and depth of expertise.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grow as Servant Leaders</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the development
of resilient character, strong socio-emotional competencies, strong servant
leadership qualities and the nurturing of school values.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be Empowered to be Stewards of Tomorrow</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the intentional
design of activities that provide authentic opportunities to practise 21st
century competencies and making them visible.</p>
