# **PEC Staff Dedication**

Presbyterian High School is part of a family of Presbyterian Schools under the care of the Presbyterian Education Council (PEC).

The Presbyterian Church in Singapore is greatly involved in the ministry and operations of the school. This is so that a holistic education can be provided for all students such that they are able to grow intellectually, spiritually, physically, socially and emotionally. It is also to guide them to become good citizens of Singapore and individuals who exhibit wisdom and stature, and find favour with God and men.

Traditionally, at the start of the year, we would have a combined staff dedication service for the 5 schools in the Presbyterian Family. This year, due to the Safe Management Measures, the staff had a virtual gathering over Zoom and were each given a snack box to enjoy. We give thanks to God for His provision and guidance.
