# **Reading Fest**

The theme for the Reading Fest this year was – “ **Caring for the Elderly:** **家有一老，如有一宝** **.** This event was held from 11 to 15 January 2021 and students were treated to interesting book sharings via recorded videos by the NLB. The two books, ‘ **Notes from the Midnight Driver** ’, by Jordan Sonnenblick and ‘ **The Cardturner** ’, by Louis Sachar; were well-received by students. Ms Chloe Lim, also shared her review on the book, ‘ **The Wind in the Willows** ’ – a heartwarming story on friendship. Last but not least, students were introduced to the concept of ‘assistive technology’ through three carefully curated news articles to help them better understand how technology can be used to help the elderly in their daily lives.
