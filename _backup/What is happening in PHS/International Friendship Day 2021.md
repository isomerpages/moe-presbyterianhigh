**International Friendship Day 2021**

PHS celebrated International Friendship Day in Week 3 of Term 2. There was a host of activities organised with the intent of letting our students learn and appreciate more about other countries and their cultures through a fun and enriching experience. These were carefully crafted and delivered in the form of Morning Fun Facts, Chapel and CF Lessons and a Kahoot Quiz. 

Even the canteen vendors joined in the celebration by serving yummy delicacies to thrill our students’ palates. A highlight of the event was the videos created by our very own foreign students. In addition, our dedicated NE Ambassadors really showed off their talents and creativity by contributing to the week long excitement!
