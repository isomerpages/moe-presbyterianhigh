# **Total Defence Day**

This year, the theme for the Total Defence Day campaign is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”. PHS held a week-long commemoration to permeate a strong Total Defence spirit in the PresHigh family. In collaboration with the student National Education (NE) ambassadors, the TD committee organised events and designed educational resources to encourage all of us to reflect on the 6 pillars of Total Defence. We considered how each of us can contribute to keeping Singapore safe, secure, and sovereign.
