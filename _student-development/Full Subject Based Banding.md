<h4>FULL SUBJECT-BASED BANDING (For 2024 Sec 1 Cohort)</h4>

Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.&nbsp;

  

The Express, N(A) and N(T) streams will be removed.

  

MOE will post students to secondary school through three Posting Groups – Posting Groups 1, 2, and 3. The PSLE score ranges for the three Posting Groups will be mapped from the existing N(T), N(A) and Express streams respectively. Posting Groups will only be used for the purposes of admitting students into secondary school and to guide the initial subject levels students can offer at the start of Secondary One.

  

Throughout their secondary school education, students can take subjects at three subject levels, known as G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General), mapped from today's N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively. Students will have the flexibility to adjust their subject levels at appropriate junctures, based on their strengths, interests and learning needs. Students will subsequently access programmes and post-secondary pathways based on their various subjects and subject level combinations.

  

<h5>Mixed Form Classes</h5>

Under FSBB, students will be in mixed form classes where they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests. In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects. 

These subjects are:

* Art
* Character and Citizenship Education
* Design and Technology
* Food and Consumer Education
* Music
* Physical Education

  

Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.

English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, Science, and Humanities subjects will be offered at G1, G2 and G3.

Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.

<b>Offering Subjects at More/Less Demanding Level</b>

At the start of Secondary 1, students will offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science at a level based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each of these subjects.&nbsp;

Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may offer these subjects at a more or less demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.

From Secondary Two, students will also be able to offer Humanities subjects (Geography, History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary One.
