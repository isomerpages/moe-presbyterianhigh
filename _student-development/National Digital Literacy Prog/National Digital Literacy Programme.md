<h1><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in&nbsp; jobs, workplaces and society.</strong> The
NDLP was launched in March 2020 to&nbsp;<strong>make digital learning inclusive</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>equipping students with the digital literacies</strong>&nbsp;to
be future-ready.</p>
<p><strong>The NDLP aims to equip our students with Digital Literacies.</strong>
</p>
<p>Digital Literacies will better enable our students, at different stages
of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate
the digital age. We hope to do this by applying the four mutually reinforcing
components in the&nbsp;<strong>'Find, Think, Apply and Create’ framework'</strong>.</p>

<p>Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will&nbsp;<strong>own a school-prescribed&nbsp;Personal Learning&nbsp;Device (PLD)</strong>.</p>
<p>The device will be used&nbsp;to facilitate an environment that&nbsp;<strong>encourages&nbsp;personalised&nbsp;learning.</strong>

<p><strong>Funding Support for&nbsp;Singapore Citizen (SC)&nbsp;Students</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The cost of the device bundle&nbsp;can be paid using your&nbsp;child’s Edusave account</strong>,&nbsp;after
setting aside provision for payment of second-tier miscellaneous fees.</p>
<p>To ensure the affordability of devices,&nbsp;<strong>there was a one-time Edusave top-up of $200</strong> in
April 2020&nbsp;to support the purchase of the device.&nbsp;(This&nbsp;is
on top of the&nbsp;<strong>annual $290</strong>&nbsp;credited into the&nbsp;Edusave&nbsp;account
for&nbsp;Secondary School students.)</p>
<p>For students&nbsp;on&nbsp;MOE-FAS, subsidies are available&nbsp;even if
there is insufficient Edusave balance. The cash&nbsp;out-of-pocket&nbsp;will
be&nbsp;$0.</p>
<p><strong>Safe and Seamless Learning Environment for Students</strong>
</p>
<p>The school has in place some measures&nbsp;<strong>to enable a safe and seamless learning environment for&nbsp;students.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;Educating students on Cyber Wellness</strong>
</p>
<p>MOE has made significant changes to the Character and Citizenship Education.
Cyber Wellness lessons will feature significantly in the CCE2021 lessons.</p>
<p>**Topics&nbsp;covered in the Cyber Wellness lessons include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cyber&nbsp;Use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber&nbsp;Identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber&nbsp;Relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber&nbsp;Citizenship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber Ethics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B.&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Management Application (DMA)</strong>
</p>
<p>Device management application (DMA)&nbsp;software&nbsp;will be installed
on your child’s device to&nbsp;provide a safe learning experience for your
child, and to&nbsp;help administer the device to enhance teaching and learning.</p>
<p><strong>C.&nbsp;Other Strategies and Support Structures in&nbsp;PHS</strong>
</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Introductory sessions to key ICT platforms for all Secondary One students&nbsp;i.e.&nbsp;Preshigh&nbsp;email</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Home-based Learning Day</strong> for Sec 1 – 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;familiarise&nbsp;students
on home-based learning and self-directed learning using&nbsp;technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborative projects that tap on use of ICT and encourage peer support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal&nbsp;lockers&nbsp;in every&nbsp;classroom which allow&nbsp;students&nbsp;to
keep&nbsp;their&nbsp;PLDs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D.&nbsp;Partnering with Parents</strong>
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;role of the parent is also key in partnering the school to support&nbsp;and
help prepare your child for an increasingly complex, interconnected and
technology-driven world.</p>
<p>You can refer to the&nbsp;Parent Handbook(I) on Learning with a Personal
Learning Device (PLD)&nbsp;which shares&nbsp;more information on how owning
a&nbsp;PLD&nbsp;will enhance the child’s learning, as well as provides
some digital parenting tips, strategies and resources.</p>
<p>This handbook is disseminated to parents via Parents Gateway and a copy
can also be found in the school’s website.</p>
