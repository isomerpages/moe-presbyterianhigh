<h3>Character and Citizenship Education</h3>
<h4>Vision</h4>
Every PresHighian who places character first and uses it as a compass to guide his or her actions and choices
<h4>Approach</h4>
With CCE2021, we aim to develop in our PresHighians:

* good character
* resilience and social-emotional well-being
* active citizenship
* future readiness.

Guiding Principles for CCE2021 Implementation:

* <b>Student-centricity</b>: We place students at the heart of all our efforts in CCE.
* <b>Intentionality</b>: We design and carry out programmes and learning experiences within and outside the classroom with intentionality, and we do not leave learning to chance.
* <b>Coherence</b>: Via a school-wide approach, we ensure that students are able to connect, transfer and apply their learning across different school contexts and learning experiences.
