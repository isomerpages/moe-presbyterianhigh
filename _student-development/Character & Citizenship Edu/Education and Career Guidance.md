<h3>Character and Citizenship Education</h3>
<h4>Vision</h4>
Every PresHighian who places character first and uses it as a compass to guide his or her actions and choices
<h4>Approach</h4>
With CCE2021, we aim to develop in our PresHighians:

* good character
* resilience and social-emotional well-being
* active citizenship
* future readiness.

Guiding Principles for CCE2021 Implementation:

* <b>Student-centricity</b>: We place students at the heart of all our efforts in CCE.
* <b>Intentionality</b>: We design and carry out programmes and learning experiences within and outside the classroom with intentionality, and we do not leave learning to chance.
* <b>Coherence</b>: Via a school-wide approach, we ensure that students are able to connect, transfer and apply their learning across different school contexts and learning experiences.

<b>(A)  CCE Curriculum Content</b>

* The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of **Identity, Relationships, and Choices**. It comprises the teaching and learning of core values, social-emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are woven across the following content areas: National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (Sed), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE).

<b>(B)  Enactment of CCE Curriculum</b>

* CCE is enacted intentionally through learning platforms such as Character First (CF) Lessons, key Student Development Experiences (SDEs), school-based initiatives, other subject lessons and learning experiences beyond school.
*
Key SDEs comprise the following:

</li><li>School Assemblies;
</li><li>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA);
</li><li>Cohort Learning Journeys (LJs);
</li><li>Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Cohort Camps;
</li><li>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Experiences;
</li><li>National Education (NE) Experiences;
</li><li>Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programmes; and
</li><li>Community Youth Leadership (CYL) Programmes.</li>
	</ul>
	
<b>(C)  Caring and Enabling Environment</b>

* A school environment that enables effective CCE is one with adult role-modelling, positive teacher-student relationships, peer support and relationships, student voice and ownership, and consistent and coherent messaging on CCE.

* To foster a caring and enabling environment, we seek to understand and address the needs and strengths of each student through multiple touch points, such as TEAM PHS Time and 1-1 chit chats with FTs.
