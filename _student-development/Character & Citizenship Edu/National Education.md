The National Education Programme focuses on helping students understand their role as citizens of Singapore and what love and commitment to the nation means.  During National Education lessons, our students learn the importance of being responsible to their families, friends and the community. They explore and develop their identity as citizens who feel a sense of belonging to the nation, grow in awareness of current societal issues, and hone their resilience in the face of challenges.
