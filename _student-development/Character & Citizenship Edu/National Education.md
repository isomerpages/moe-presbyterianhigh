<p>The National Education Programme focuses on helping students understand
their role as citizens of Singapore and what love and commitment to the
nation means. During National Education lessons, our students learn the
importance of being responsible to their families, friends and the community.
They explore and develop their identity as citizens who feel a sense of
belonging to the nation, grow in awareness of current societal issues,
and hone their resilience in the face of challenges.</p>
