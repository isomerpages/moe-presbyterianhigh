<h3>Character and Citizenship Education</h3>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Every PresHighian who places character first and uses it as a compass
to guide his or her actions and choices</p>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>With CCE2021, we aim to develop in our PresHighians:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>good character</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resilience and social-emotional well-being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>active citizenship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>future readiness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guiding Principles for CCE2021 Implementation:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Student-centricity</strong>: We place students at the heart of
all our efforts in CCE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intentionality</strong>: We design and carry out programmes and
learning experiences within and outside the classroom with intentionality,
and we do not leave learning to chance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coherence</strong>: Via a school-wide approach, we ensure that
students are able to connect, transfer and apply their learning across
different school contexts and learning experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(A) CCE Curriculum Content</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of <strong>Identity, Relationships, and Choices</strong>.
It comprises the teaching and learning of core values, social-emotional
competencies and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing a
sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are woven across the
following content areas: National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (Sed),
Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness
(CW), and Family Education (FE).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(B) Enactment of CCE Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>CCE is enacted intentionally through learning platforms such as Character
First (CF) Lessons, key Student Development Experiences (SDEs), school-based
initiatives, other subject lessons and learning experiences beyond school.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Key SDEs comprise the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>TEAM PHS Time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapel and Daily Devotions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School Assemblies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cohort Learning Journeys (LJs);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Cohort Camps;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Experiences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Education (NE) Experiences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programmes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community Youth Leadership (CYL) Programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(C) Caring and Enabling Environment</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A school environment that enables effective CCE is one with adult role-modelling,
positive teacher-student relationships, peer support and relationships,
student voice and ownership, and consistent and coherent messaging on CCE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To foster a caring and enabling environment, we seek to understand and
address the needs and strengths of each student through multiple touch
points, such as TEAM PHS Time and 1-1 chit chats with FTs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
