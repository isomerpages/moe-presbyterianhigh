# **DSA SPORTS**

**(Basketball, Volleyball &amp; Table Tennis)**


Presbyterian High School provides players in Basketball, Table Tennis and Volleyball opportunities for a broad-based education through the development of character and the inculcation of knowledge and acquisition of skills to lead a healthy lifestyle. The Sports Excellence Programme also aims to groom the players into socially responsible pupils capable of serving and meeting the needs of the school and the community. The school deploys a team of committed teachers and engages certified coaches to develop the players’ potential and talents towards sports excellence. The school provides platforms for the student-athletes to hone their skills and deepen their passion for the sports.
