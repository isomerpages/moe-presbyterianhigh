# **DSA STEM**

**(Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math)**

##### DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION (DSA) EXERCISE 2023
Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) seeks to broaden our students’ exposure to Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics (STEM) through Health and Food Science to promote sustainable lifestyles. We leverage ALP to inspire our students on the beauty of discovery and innovation. We want to raise the aspiration of students to pursue STEM-related courses and careers to address challenges of the future. Through hands-on exploration and discovery, students learn about organic chemistry through soap making and beeswax wrap making. Students will also get to develop computational skills through coding with micro:bit. They will apply the design thinking process and use their computational skills and knowledge to ideate and design prototypes to solve real-world problems.
