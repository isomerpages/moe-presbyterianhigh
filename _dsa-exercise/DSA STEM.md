# **DSA STEM**

**(Science, Technology, Engineering & Math)**

##### DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION (DSA) EXERCISE 2022
The school leverages its Applied Learning Programme (ALP) to inspire our young on the beauty of discovering and creating things, and raise the aspiration of students to pursue STEM-related courses and careers to address challenges of the future so as to improve lives. Through authentic learning experiences in the area of Health Science, our ALP develops competencies such as critical and inventive thinking, grit and problem solving skills in our students. Students will also be exposed to block-based coding using micro:bit and develop prototypes to solve real-life issues.
