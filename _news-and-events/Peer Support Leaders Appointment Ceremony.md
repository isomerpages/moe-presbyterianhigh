# **Peer Support Leaders Appointment Ceremony**

In tandem with the school’s culture of care, the inaugural Peer Support Leaders Appointment Ceremony was held on 16 July 2021. Peer Support Leaders play an active role in supporting and looking out for their peers both emotionally and socially. We hope that this peer support culture will involve students in building an inclusive school.
