Our CCA programme seeks to provide our players with a holistic experience of training, service learning and character building. Our weekly CCA sessions develop our students' ball skills and teamwork, and improve their individual fitness. 

“I have learnt how to work as a team. In a team sports, I need to know how to communicate with my teammates so that I can score a goal. I have also learnt to be resilient and think like a winner instead of giving up prematurely.” - Joel Poli

“As the Captain of the team, I have learnt the importance of playing my role well. Captains need more than just good ball-handling skills; they also need to have chemistry with their teammates. Football isn’t just a physically demanding sport, but a mental battle with one’s opponents too. I’ve enjoyed the CCA, knowing that I have my friends by my side.” - Huang Siheng

“I have learnt resilience, teamwork and responsibility. I’ve learnt that I should continue playing, even when being tackled. My coaches and teachers encouraged my teammates and I to fight back even when we are trailing behind. In spite of the pandemic, we dutifully practised at home and attended virtual training sessions. Lastly, I’ve learnt to work in a team, to cooperate with one another and learn from our mistakes.” - Nikhil Shyam Dinesh

“I have learnt the importance of teamwork. A football match is played with 11 players, not one. No matter how good one is in football, he needs to work together with his teammates in order to win a game.” - Alfred Wong Wei Lun
