With discipline, intensive training and teamwork, both our Boys and Girls team do well in competitions. The training sessions seek to cultivate self-discipline, team spirit and perseverance in students. 

“I’ve learnt how to work as a team and support one another throughout the table tennis matches regardless of the score. I have also learnt that sportsmanship is very important, and I should strive to put friendship first before winning. My team and I put in a lot of effort in our training and we were very happy to have come in 2nd place in the ‘B’ Division Girls South Zone Competition. I realise that as a team, when we put our mind to achieving something, we will be unstoppable.” - Kimberlyn Chuah Yong Hui

“I have learnt to work together as a team and even when we lose a match, we don't blame one other. Instead, we learn from the experience, give one another emotional support, and encourage one another to try again the next time. My communication skills have also improved as I learnt how to listen to my teammates’ opinions during training sessions and competitions, before deciding on how best to proceed.” - Liew Wei Ren, Wicus 

“I have learnt how to work as a team and bring everyone together. As the Vice-Captain of the team, it is part of my job to lead the team alongside the Captain. Previously, we were not united as a team, but the year’s experiences had brought everyone together. I was also able to hone my leadership skills, and my table tennis skills have improved too. I have learnt many different values such as discipline and sportsmanship.” - Foo Jing Hui Deanna
