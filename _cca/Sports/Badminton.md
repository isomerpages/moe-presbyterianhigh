The Badminton Club aims to hone students’ badminton skills and build their physical stamina to a competitive level. We also seek to nurture professionalism and sportsmanship in all our students. By instilling discipline and a sense of responsibility in our players, we hope that they would become Promise Keepers, Hope Builders and Servant Leaders in the future.

“I have made many vivid and positive memories in my four years in the Badminton CCA. My workload as a student could sometimes be overwhelming and stressful. Playing badminton is a way for me to relax and unwind, since exercise, for me, is an escape from the stress and pressure of my everyday life. I have not only learnt more about badminton, but have also made a lot of friends who have supported me physically and emotionally every step of the way. I am also thankful to be appointed as the captain for “B” boys and am grateful to be given the Sportsmanship Award in the Badminton Championships 2021.” - Nyo Cheng Xuan Darius

“I have had the opportunity to participate in competitions and make friends with players from other schools. I was able to learn many things from the coach, who helped me to hone my badminton skills. Although my team members and I faced many challenges along the way, we managed to overcome them together. I am also very grateful and honoured to receive the Thanksgiving CCA award for Badminton.” - Joan Tay Jia Xuen
