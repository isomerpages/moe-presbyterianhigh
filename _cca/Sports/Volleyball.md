Volleyball at PHS involves both the school team and the recreational team. Through the course of rigorous training, all teams acquire an appreciation for and practical knowledge of volleyball skills, and the rules and regulations of the game. Separately, students also gain experience and valuable life skills through leadership opportunities both on and off court. A team of dedicated coaches and teachers-in-charge work with our players to impart volleyball knowledge and skills and at the same time, nurture their characters. Our training sessions comprise fitness training, skill-based drills and tactical team play.  

“Being new to secondary school, I had to cope with more subjects and learn how to manage my studies and CCA commitments. Though hectic, I really enjoyed making new friends and learning from my seniors. As a volleyball player, I have learnt that both teamwork and perseverance are important while learning to work with my new friends. The intensive training sessions made me realise that I need to have perseverance. Although we moved to eCCA later in the year, I still enjoyed the training sessions as I could do exercises at my own pace in the comfort of my own room. With the support of my peers and seniors, my passion for volleyball grew considerably stronger and I hope we will be able to train together again and take part in more competitions next year.” - Julia Chng

“What I enjoyed most about CCA this year was being able to spend time with my teammates. Although the pandemic meant that I did not get to spend as much time with the full team as I typically would, I cherished all the time spent with my seniors. When training was brought online, I struggled with keeping fit as training sessions were no longer as intensive. To overcome my loss of stamina, I went on long jogs with my sister and we participated in extra workout sessions on our own. When face to face sessions resumed, I realised that I had more stamina than I had expected. I felt very proud of myself. Ultimately, volleyball has become one of the best parts of my life and I have fallen more in love with the sport especially after competing in the ‘B’ Division team earlier in the year. I treasure not just playing the sport itself, but the values that the sport has taught me too such as perseverance and how to be a good leader. I have developed my skills and watched myself mature; I am so glad I chose Volleyball as my CCA.” - Jeslyn Teo
  
“As we prepared to compete as a ‘B’ Division team this year, we encountered several difficulties, including injuries, tough fixtures and changing circumstances, resulting in face-to-face training being paused for some time. However, we continued to persevere through training sessions and trained on our own. We adapted quickly to the new rules and despite the sudden changes, we were able to play well during the competition, with every member of the team contributing to our success on the court. All in all, the past four years have been very memorable for us and our achievements would not have been possible if not for the hard work, dedication and exemplary teamwork demonstrated by all in the team.” - Clayton Lau and Branden Yee
