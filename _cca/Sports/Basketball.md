We aim to give our players the opportunity to hone their basketball skills, which include various ball-handling and shooting techniques, as well as to develop the values of teamwork, good communication, discipline and perseverance. Each year, players look forward to competing in friendly matches with other schools locally and overseas, and the National Schools games. 

“Basketball definitely played an integral part in my PHS life. The court was like my second home as life-long friendships were formed here. In training sessions, even with the most vigorous drills (occasionally paired with some tiger balm patches on our arms and legs), I was able to push through with a smile thanks to my beloved teammates. Not to mention how we all simply love to celebrate our small successes together, as though our team had just won the Olympics. I’ll surely look back on these fond memories even 10 years from now! Looking back, I realise our setbacks had only made us emerge stronger and more resilient. I am so grateful and proud to be part of this lovely team alongside our coaches and Mr Huang Ying since the day I joined the CCA. To all student athletes and all my Basketball juniors, remember to take a moment to appreciate everyone around you. While you train hard, don’t forget to enjoy the process! 长老会篮球队 whoosh!” - Sasha Anand

“My experience in Basketball has been meaningful. Although COVID-19 has brought about many disruptions to the basketball team, we encouraged and supported one another along the way. Through this episode, I have learnt values such as perseverance and patience. I have also learnt that members of Basketball are parts of a body that forms a team. ‘I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.’ Let's press on together!” - Jonathan Cheok

“My experience in basketball has been fruitful and enjoyable. Normally during training, we would engage in conditioning work such as running defensive slides. We also engage in strength training with exercises like lunges, squats and flutter kicks. Most importantly, we brush up on our skills by doing different shooting or dribbling drills. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, when heightened restrictions were in place, we had to switch to online training via zoom. We did our exercises at home and analysed footage of past matches, which kept us in shape and prevented us from slacking off before physical training sessions resumed. Being in basketball has taught me responsibility, perseverance, and the importance of having a growth mindset. To my teammates and anybody who wishes to join Basketball, regardless of the circumstances, never give up and to always do your best.” - Elijah Chionh
