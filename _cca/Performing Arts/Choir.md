# **Choir**

![](/images/Choir.jpg)

Under the baton of Mr Ong Kok Leong, the members of the United Voices of PHS learn a repertoire of songs of different languages, periods and styles. The choristers commit to hours of weekly practice virtually, holding fast to the belief that every member plays a vital role in the overall sound quality. Collectively, they create music that is powerful and beautiful: a sound that a singer alone can never create. This experience of music making is empowering yet humbling. The training received is rewarding as the choristers hone important life skills and cultivate strong values, while forging healthy relationships with their peers. By the end of their choral education, they would develop strong vocal techniques and social and emotional competencies that will stand them in good stead for the future.

“During choir practices, I learnt many new techniques, such as ways to breathe while singing. We also use many singing exercises, many of which I have never heard of before I joined the choir. I am more confident in singing in front of others and more interested in singing than when I first joined choir. - George Natalie Mariam Jimmy

“After joining Choir, I realised that there are different sections to make a choir whole. With many voices, we can harmonise, and that makes us a choir when we sing together. The bonds of friendship in Choir are strong as we have many friends from different sections. They, together with the teachers and seniors, help us to improve our singing.” - Chang Yan Yin
  
“As being in the choir is about singing well as a big group, these past two years have been extremely challenging for us. However, we were able to learn and sing our own parts well, and some of us even made videos for school celebrations. This motivated me to be resilient and never give up in the face of setbacks. Thus, my singing also improved. I am thankful for my peers, teachers, instructor and even the seniors who have graduated. Without their hard work, the choir wouldn’t be so strong. Although we have been through much from this pandemic, Choir still keeps me going.”  - Shun Lei Hnin
