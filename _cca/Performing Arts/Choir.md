<p>The Choir learns a repertoire of songs of different periods, styles and
languages. The choristers commit to weekly practices, holding fast to the
belief that each of them plays a vital role in the quality of sound. Their
choral training not only stands them in good stead to participate in the
Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and performances in school and
in public, but also builds their confidence, leadership skills and character.
Collectively, the choir produces music that a singer alone cannot create.&nbsp;</p>
