The Choir learns a repertoire of songs of different periods, styles and languages. The choristers commit to weekly practices, holding fast to the belief that each of them plays a vital role in the quality of sound. Their choral training not only stands them in good stead to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and performances in school and in public, but also builds their confidence, leadership skills and character. Collectively, the choir produces music that a singer alone cannot create.&nbsp;
