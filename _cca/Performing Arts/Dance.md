PHS Dance Society has a vision to nurture disciplined and resilient dancers who work as a team to strive for success. The Dance Society provides dancers with a creative outlet, allowing them to express themselves through the beauty of dance. Every individual is unique and different. The Dance Society emphasises this by giving students opportunities to express their individuality while working together as a group to shine brightly.
