Modern Dance aims to nurture disciplined and resilient dancers who work cohesively towards success. Recognising the uniqueness of each dancer, the CCA offers creative platforms for them to express their individuality and appreciate the beauty of dance. With an emphasis on values and character, our dancers develop a strong sense of commitment to honing their craft, and learn to cultivate mutual respect and a strong sense of teamwork.
