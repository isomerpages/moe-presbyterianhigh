Established in 2001 by the late founding father of PHS Reverend Lee Huai Kwang, the Chinese Orchestra has grown from strength to strength, and created a legacy of members and ex-members who share a love for Chinese music. We believe in helping our members develop not only their musical skills but a deeper appreciation for the rich tradition of Chinese musical culture.

“This is my third year in the Chinese Orchestra as a percussionist. This year, one memorable experience I had was taking part in the SYF Arts Presentation for the first time. The experience has made me a more resilient, confident and responsible person. When I first joined the cello section, I was not confident. I had neither played a percussion instrument before nor was I close to the other members in the percussion section. However, my doubts were dispelled after I went for several practice sessions. Over time, I grew closer to my fellow percussionists, making the practice sessions both fun and meaningful. I am really grateful to be part of the Chinese Orchestra and to have met all my CCA friends.” - Cheng Shuya

“It has been a challenging yet enriching year at CCA. Our main focus of the year was preparing for the SYF Arts Presentation. Although managing studies and CCA was difficult, my CCA friends and I encouraged and motivated one another along the way. It was through these times that I realised the Chinese Orchestra was more than just a CCA to me. It was a family that supported and cared for one another. I am also very grateful to be given an Executive Committee role in the CCA. From learning how to lead a section to working closely with teachers to run the CCA, I have gained a lot from this process.” - Cao Jinghan

“The COVID-19 pandemic had really put the CCA in a difficult position. Due to the heightened Safe Management Measures, the different sections had to be separated from one another. Instruments like percussion and double bass could not be carried back home which really affected us when we had e-CCA sessions. Despite the challenges, we performed well for the SYF Arts Presentation. I am grateful to my CO instructor, Mr Wei, who has taught us patiently. I am also thankful to all the members in my CCA who have put in so much effort for the SYF. Without them, it would have been impossible for us to be awarded a Certificate of Distinction.” - Ding Yuzhe
