<p>The English Drama Club is dedicated to nurturing students’ talents in
storytelling, artistic expression and stage performance. Through drama,
students develop the confidence to express themselves passionately while
exploring a range of theatrical techniques and creative forms. The club
brings together a community of like-minded individuals who find joy and
purpose in captivating and inspiring audiences.</p>
<p>Beyond acting, members acquire a variety of complementary skills. They
learn to write scripts, design and create props, and source sound effects
that enhance dramatic scenes. Students also take on backstage roles, such
as stage management, which involves coordinating performers and overseeing
the flow of the performance. These diverse experiences foster collaboration,
leadership and creative problem-solving, equipping students with both artistic
and practical skills that extend beyond the stage.</p>
