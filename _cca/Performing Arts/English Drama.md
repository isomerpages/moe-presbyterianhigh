Since its inception in 2005, the members of the PhDrama Club have been striving for excellence in whatever they do. In 2016, they participated in the prestigious Human Values Drama Festival competition and were awarded the ‘Best Actor’ award. The club achieved a Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in 2015 and a Certificate of Accomplishment in 2017, 2019 and 2021. The club offers a variety of opportunities for members to gain experience, build confidence and develop themselves in many areas such as designing props, writing scripts and acting. Through our productions, the Drama Club strives to explore relevant topics in everyday life and give a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves. Our students develop their creativity and sensitivity during drama practices in a fun and engaging way. 

In drama class, I am free.  
I can be a window or even a tree.  
Lively laughter,  
Like fairy tails’ happy ever after.  
  
We work hard  
To make a play,  
That comes from our heart,  
On every CCA day.

In drama class where there is joy and liveliness,   
We put our burdens away.  
A place where we jump, crawl, run, walk, laugh, love and live our lives to the fullest.   
We join hands together to make a beautiful and meaningful piece,   
On which we will reminisce  
A few years from now.    
Drama class is what we will laugh and talk merrily about in the future.

My Drama Class, every Monday and Wednesday,   
3.30pm to 5.30pm, the 2 hours seem long,    
Yet it is never enough.   
Extended by at least 15 minutes, we bid farewell.   
But it is never a farewell when we still think about it through the week.    
We play, we bond, we act, but most importantly,   
We work together to bring our performance to life,  
During our drama class.
