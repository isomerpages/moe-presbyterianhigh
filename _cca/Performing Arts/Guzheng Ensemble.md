**Introduction**

Under the guidance of the Guzheng instructor and teachers-in-charge, the Guzheng Ensemble achieved commendable awards at the Singapore Youth Festival yearly. On this journey to success, the members put their heart and soul into practising their 21-stringed Chinese musical instruments. Together, they strove to produce harmonious music that is played expressively and learnt the importance of teamwork, diligence and perseverance.
