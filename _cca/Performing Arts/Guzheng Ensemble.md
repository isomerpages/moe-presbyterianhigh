# **Guzheng Ensemble**

![](/images/Guzheng.jpeg)

The PHS Guzheng Ensemble was founded in the year 2002, with the aim of promoting Chinese cultural values through music while cultivating artistic appreciation among our members. Members of the Guzheng Ensemble learn the importance of teamwork, diligence and perseverance. The time spent together at CCA sessions enables our members to strengthen not only their love for the Guzheng but also their bonds of friendship.

“Guzheng is a very fun and enjoyable CCA. The instructor is firm, but kind. She taught us that we must have patience and perseverance in order to see improvements in our Guzheng skills. Our seniors are also very approachable, helpful and kind. They would also try their best to teach and guide us.” - Ho Zheng Han

“My experience in my CCA has helped me to learn more about our school values. I learnt how to be more responsible as our instructor would assign different people to be in charge of different areas. Some of us were in charge of ensuring that members are punctual for CCA training sessions; others were responsible for reminding everyone to do the homework assigned by our instructor. I also learnt the importance of having integrity and not being afraid to learn from my mistakes. We are taught to respect one another, show empathy to friends who are facing challenges and help them along the way.” - Tan Xinvi

“As a member of the Guzheng Ensemble for three years, I have learnt many things and made many friends. I have also learnt the importance of resilience. During the SYF, we went through intensive training. We did not gave up even when the going got tough. Even when CCA lessons were suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we continued practising on our own. Our hard work paid off when we were awarded with a Certificate of Distinction at the SYF Arts Presentation. I remembered vividly our CCA VIA project in 2019, when we went to SUN-DAC – a non-profit social service agency for persons with disabilities – to bless the residents at the day-care centre. It was truly an enriching experience.” - Seah Rui En
