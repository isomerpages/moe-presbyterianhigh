<p>The Symphonic Band aims to develop every student’s musical abilities.
Regardless of their prior musical experience, students will learn to play
music as part of a band, and nurture an appreciation for music. Besides
developing their aptitude and interest in music, the CCA places an emphasis
on maximising leadership potential in all students.</p>
