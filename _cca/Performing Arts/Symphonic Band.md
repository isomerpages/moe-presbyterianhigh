The Symphonic Band aims to develop every student’s musical abilities. Regardless of their prior musical experience, students will learn to play music as part of a band, and nurture an appreciation for music. Besides developing their aptitude and interest in music, the CCA places an emphasis on maximising leadership potential in all students.
