**Introduction**

PHS Symphonic Band's mission is to develop and hone studentsâ€™ musical abilities. Even without prior background, students will learn to experience playing music together and nurture an appreciation for music. Apart from developing the students' musical performance ability, the PHS Symphonic Band also emphasises on character development and strives to maximise leadership potential in all students.
