The National Police Cadet Corps aspires to be the best youth organisation in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world. It develops its cadets into active citizens and community leaders by collaborating with the Singapore Police Force to fight against crime and keep Singapore safe. It also hones the cadets’ leadership skills by providing the cadets with opportunities to participate in authentic police programmes, such as Crime Scene Investigation, Crime Prevention and adventure training camps.
