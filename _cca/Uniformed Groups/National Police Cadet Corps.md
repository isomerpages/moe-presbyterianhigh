<p>The National Police Cadet Corps aspires to be the best youth organisation
in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place
in the world. It develops its cadets into active citizens and community
leaders by collaborating with the Singapore Police Force to fight against
crime and keep Singapore safe. It also hones the cadets’ leadership skills
by providing the cadets with opportunities to participate in authentic
police programmes, such as Crime Scene Investigation, Crime Prevention
and adventure training camps.</p>
