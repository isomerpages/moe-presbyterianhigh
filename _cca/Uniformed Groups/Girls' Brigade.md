The Girls’ Brigade (GB) seeks to develop each Girl to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling every Girl to be a leader. To fulfil this mission, the GB programme involves each Girl in badgework activities and community service. This cultivates character and values, while strengthening the Girls’ sisterhood and camaraderie.
