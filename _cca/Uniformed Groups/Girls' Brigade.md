<p>The Girls’ Brigade (GB) seeks to develop each Girl to her fullest potential
by equipping, empowering and enabling every Girl to be a leader. To fulfil
this mission, the GB programme involves each Girl in badgework activities
and community service. This cultivates character and values, while strengthening
the Girls’ sisterhood and camaraderie.</p>
