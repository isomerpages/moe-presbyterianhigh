The NPCC aims to nurture cadets into: 

*   morally upright and law-abiding citizens, 
*   citizens who possess integrity,
*   selfless individuals who contribute to the safety and security of the community, 
*   resilient individuals who persevere in adverse and rugged contexts, 
*   and individuals who are entrepreneurial and global in outlook so that they can adapt to changing contexts.
    
The NPCC seeks to give our cadets opportunities to hone their leadership skills.

“NPCC has molded me into who I am today: a student and cadet with discipline and the drive to achieve more. It has opened my eyes to a world of law enforcement, the law and imparted many life skills such as knot tying. Without NPCC, I wouldn't have achieved as much as I have today.” - Zack Ngiam Yi Wei

“NPCC has provided me with many enriching experiences, one of which will stay with me for the rest of my life. For example, I will always remember helping out as a flag party member during the National Day Observance Ceremony. I also had the opportunity to plan for events like the CCA Open House. The greatest reward that I have reaped from NPCC is the lifelong friendships with my squad mates. They are the true joy that NPCC has brought me.” - Chia Han Gin Alden

“I have learnt that teamwork and communication are key in the NPCC as we work together to achieve certain tasks that would not be possible if carried out alone, such as running the CCA and pitching a tent within a time limit. I have also learnt that planning ahead is critical to ensure the smooth running of activities. Being adaptable is also important as unexpected circumstances might derail our plans and we have to think on our feet to come up with solutions and alternative plans. I would definitely wish to come back to PHS to help out with instructing juniors and giving back to the CCA wherever possible.” - Johnathan Lim Zhi Wei
