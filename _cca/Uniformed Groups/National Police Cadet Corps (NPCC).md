**Introduction**<br>
The NPCC seeks to give our cadets opportunities to hone their leadership skills through authentic and relevant police programmes such as Crime Scene Investigation, Crime Prevention, adventure training camps and more. The NPCC Unit follows the NPCC vision to become the best youth organization in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world. We aim to develop our members to become active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.
