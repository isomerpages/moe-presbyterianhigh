<p>The National Cadet Corps (Sea) is dedicated to developing its cadets into
extraordinary youth leaders of tomorrow. Our cadets participate in land
modules and sea activities, where they acquire knowledge about the military,
naval traditions, fitness training and kayaking. Proficiency badges are
earned when they acquire the related skills and competencies. Our cadets
are not only resilient but they also embody core values, such as loyalty
to country, uprightness, leadership, discipline, commitment and responsibility,
care for fellow cadets, an adventurous spirit and safety. &nbsp;</p>
