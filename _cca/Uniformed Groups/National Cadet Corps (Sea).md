The National Cadet Corps (Sea) is dedicated to developing its cadets into extraordinary youth leaders of tomorrow. Our cadets participate in land modules and sea activities, where they acquire knowledge about the military, naval traditions, fitness training and kayaking. Proficiency badges are earned when they acquire the related skills and competencies. Our cadets are not only resilient but they also embody core values, such as loyalty to country, uprightness, leadership, discipline, commitment, responsibility, and care for fellow cadets.&nbsp;
