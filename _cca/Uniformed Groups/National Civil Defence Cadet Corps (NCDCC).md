We Learn, We Lead, We Serve. We believe in developing and empowering our cadets to be active and concerned citizens with life-saving skills. During CCA sessions, all our cadets pick up life skills like basic firefighting and first aid. They also learn to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use the automated external defibrillators in times of need. As part of efforts to enhance our cadets’ community emergency preparedness, Secondary 2 cadets undergo the SGSecure training. 

“Even though CCA sessions were largely conducted online, I have learnt a lot about how to respond in emergency situations. The NCDCC experience was still very enriching, preparing us for real-life crises.” - SGT Bryson Oh 

“Due to the COVID-19 Safe Management Measures, we were unable to meet physically for CCA. However, thanks to e-CCA sessions, my NCDCC cadets and I still managed to learn a lot from the online lessons and assignments that our teachers have planned for us. The learning process was even easier and more enjoyable than I had expected!” - SGT Ashok Kumar Vasanthan
 
“Although we could not have a passing out parade due to the pandemic, the juniors had planned a programme for us to relive the memories we had created together in our NCDCC journey. It was certainly a meaningful and memorable experience for the Secondary Four cadets.” - SSG Melvin Loh
