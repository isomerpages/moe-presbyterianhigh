**Introduction**<br>
The PHS NCC (Sea) unit aims to develop its cadets into extraordinary youth leaders of tomorrow. Apart from being resilient individuals, cadets will imbibe core values such as loyalty to country, uprightness, leadership, discipline, commitment and responsibility, care for fellow cadets, adventurous spirit, and safety. Cadets undergo land modules and sea activities to learn about military knowledge and naval traditions, fitness training as well as kayaking experience. Proficiency badges will be awarded as cadets acquire the related skills and competencies.
