The cadets also participate in many exciting courses and programmes:

*   Maritime Singapore Education Series (Secondary 4)  
*   Republic of Singapore Navy Virtual Engagement Session (Secondary 4)

“The teachers and the senior cadets were very welcoming towards me when I first joined the CCA. I remembered my first training session vividly. There participated in physical training and learnt about foot drills, seamanship terms, and bends and hitches. During the March holidays, I had the chance to experience the 1-star kayaking course. I have learnt values like Loyalty to Country, Uprightness, Leadership, Discipline, Commitment, Responsibility, and Care.” - Lee Yong Han Gavin

“Over the past year, I have learnt a lot in NCC (Sea). I have learnt to persevere and work together with my platoon mates. NCC (Sea) has helped me make new friends and it has taught me discipline. The activities and the events that took place over the year had been very exciting and although there were restrictions due to COVID-19, a lot of fun and learning still took place during CCA sessions.” - Kimaya Vijay Warrier  

“My NCC (Sea) experience has been filled with opportunities to learn, teach and bond with my juniors via Zoom. I taught my junior cadet members how to tie certain knots required for seamanship and shared with them my passion for NCC. I also had the chance to participate in NCC HQ events such as the sea competition on a virtual platform. It was a very interesting experience!” - Muhammad Nurfadil Bin Minhat
