<p>The Boys’ Brigade’s (BB) vision is to be the youth organisation of choice.
The CCA is focused on nurturing and grooming Boys to become leaders of
tomorrow. The BB’s badge work system and values-driven programmes continue
to be key in the holistic development of the Boys. Values are inculcated
during drills and through activities, such as leadership camps, bagpipe
playing, community service, kayaking, knot tying and structure building.</p>
