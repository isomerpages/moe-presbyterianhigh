# **Boys' Brigade**

**Introduction**

The vision of Boys’ Brigade (BB) is to be the Youth Organisation of choice. We are focused on nurturing and grooming boys to become leaders of tomorrow. BB’s badge work system and its values-driven programmes continue to be key in the holistic development of the boys. Values are inculcated during drills and through activities such as leadership camps, bagpipe playing, community service, kayaking, knot tying and structure building.
