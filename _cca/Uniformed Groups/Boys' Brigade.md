# **Boys' Brigade**

![](/images/BB.jpg)


At the Boys’ Brigade, our mission is to nurture in our Boys Christian values to serve and lead. Through our CCA programme, the Boys acquire skills and knowledge in the areas of Leadership, Personal Mastery, Global Awareness and Community Spiritedness. We seek to inculcate the habits of obedience, reverence, discipline and self-respect in them. We mould our Boys’ character through our Bible teaching sessions, and they pick up life skills through badgework sessions. The 27th Company also boasts a bagpipe band that trains and performs at school events, and takes part in the annual Pipes and Drums Fiesta.

“In my first year at the Boys’ Brigade, I learnt many things such as knot tying and map reading. However, the most important thing I learnt is taking responsibility and being accountable for my mistakes. Once, during a BB parade, my cohort had to do a drill practice and whenever we made a mistake, all of us would get punished. Even though we were the ones who were being disciplined, our BB Officers took it upon themselves to undergo the punishment together with us. That experience gave me a strong sense of brotherhood with my BB team members and all our BB Officers.” - PTE Daniel Yap

“My Boys’ Brigade journey has been an enriching and fruitful one thus far. Throughout my two years in this CCA, I have learnt several important values such as self-discipline. The Captain and Officers in the Company put in their utmost effort to teach us right from wrong and guide us towards the right path. In addition, the Character Education lessons have taught me to be respectful towards one another and to strive to be the best version of myself. Being in the Boys’ Brigade has developed my character and made me a better person.” - LCP Ernest Long
  
“The Boys’ Brigade has taught me many things, one of which is leadership. I am given responsibilities like teaching and guiding my juniors. I have also learnt the value and importance of respect. Most importantly, I have learnt discipline through the regular drill sessions.” - SGT Noah Chew
