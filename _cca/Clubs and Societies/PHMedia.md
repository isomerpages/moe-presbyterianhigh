“Photography takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still.” – Dorothea Lange. In PHMedia, our members learn the importance of capturing significant yet fleeting moments in life. Our Lower Secondary members acquire the skills of using a Digital Single-lens Reflex (DSLR) camera to take pictures and videos. Additionally, they learn how to edit pictures for the purposes of school publicity. To nurture confidence, our Upper Secondary members get opportunities to do public speaking and conduct enrichment courses on video editing for their juniors. 

“PHMedia is a place to learn about the wonders of photography and videography. I was able to learn how to use a camera properly and capture footage for a school video. Additionally, PHMedia has taught me to be creative, versatile and bold to try out new things. My time in PHMedia is very well-spent and I am very happy to be in PHMedia.” \-  Shaun Tan

  
  

“In PHMedia, we learn how to take photos with more depth and meaning. This is very relevant to our daily lives as we are exposed to so many images in the media in this digital age. I’ve also developed a deep appreciation for photographers as I realise that a lot of time and effort goes into capturing significant moments and creating the ideal photograph. I enjoy my time in the CCA and deeply appreciate what the teachers have planned for us.” - Rebekka Lim

  
“At PHMedia, I had the opportunity to look at things from a different perspective - through the lens of a camera. I picked up many useful skills like video editing, animation and professional photography. It is really amazing how a camera can capture all the beautiful moments and turn them into a memory. During the pandemic, we were tasked to impart certain skills to junior members of the CCA during our eCCA sessions. This was a great opportunity for me to develop my confidence and leadership skills as I had to work with my team of Executive Committee members to guide our juniors along. We taught our juniors how to edit videos and use a DSLR camera.” - Jeslyn Neo
