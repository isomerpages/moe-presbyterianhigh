<p>PHMedia’s mission is to create awareness of the importance of capturing
significant yet fleeting moments in daily life. Our Lower Secondary members
acquire the necessary skills of using a Digital Single-lens Reflex (DSLR)
camera to capture pictures and videos, and editing them for the purposes
of school publicity. To nurture confidence, our Upper Secondary members
are given opportunities to engage in public speaking and conduct enrichment
courses on video editing for their juniors.</p>
