**Introduction**<br>
Photography takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still.” – Dorothea Lange. Our mission in PHMedia is to help our members understand the importance of capturing significant yet fleeting moments in life. Our Lower Secondary members acquire the skills of using a Digital Single-lens Reflex (DSLR) camera to take pictures and videos and edit them for the purposes of school publicity. To nurture confidence, our Upper Secondary members get opportunities to do public speaking and conduct enrichment courses on video editing for their juniors.
