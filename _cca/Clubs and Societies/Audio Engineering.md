<p>The Audio Engineering Club aims to cultivate students’ skills in audio
reinforcement for live concerts and emerging technologies in New Media.
It provides valuable hands-on learning opportunities for students to sharpen
their communication and leadership skills. Comprising a dedicated group
of students, the club also serves the school diligently and responsibly
in various events and programmes throughout the year. By extending their
support during school events, the club inculcates values and builds character
and resilience in students.</p>
