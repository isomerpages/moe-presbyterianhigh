# **Audio Engineering**

![](/images/audio1.jpg)

Members of the Audio Engineering Club learn how to work with and manage the technical aspects of sound during the processes of recording, mixing and reproduction. They also learn how to troubleshoot and carry out minor fixes on audio equipment should the need arise. Audio Engineering Club members play a critical role in ensuring the audio-visual quality of performances during school events. 

  

“I have learnt many things related to audio engineering. For example, I learnt how to set up the sound system properly for the morning assembly. It may look simple but it requires very specialised knowledge. I have learnt how to work under pressure and how to think on my feet to resolve a technical glitch when it arises. I like the company of friends that I have made in the CCA and the members of the alumni are very nurturing; they come back to teach us fun things such as how to use a mixer. I enjoy the CCA very much as I have picked up very useful and practical skills from it.” - Tan Zhen Wen

  

“Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these two years have been very tough for most of our members, but we pulled through and tried our best to enjoy what little time we had together as a team. Although most of our CCA sessions were held online, all of us tried to learn as much as possible from each session and asked questions to clarify our doubts. At the start of the year, when we had face-to-face sessions, we had hands-on sessions where we practised setting up the sound system for various scenarios. I learnt to be more independent and try to fix problems on my own before asking for help. I have also learnt how to work together as a team, making friends along the way. I appreciate the efforts of my teachers and seniors.” - Javen Cho

  
“Despite the heightened restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, CCA still proved itself to be fun and enjoyable. Our teachers and seniors worked very hard to bring the CCA online, and I have learnt about a wide variety of audio topics, ranging from flight cases to the set-up configuration required for the Performing Arts CCAs. While events set-up were quite different due to social distancing measures, I was glad to be able to practise setting up the sound equipment for small-scaled events with safe distancing measures in place.” - Chloe Que
