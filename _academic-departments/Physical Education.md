<p><strong>Our Vision</strong>
<br>Every PresHighian a robust individual who is fit, knowledgeable and skilled
at pursuing an active and healthy lifestyle</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
<br>The Physical Education (PE) Department achieves its vision through four
key pillars of physical education: fitness, health, sports and outdoor
education.</p>
<p>The department introduces students to physical health education, eight
core sports modules and outdoor education, all aimed at developing students
into individuals who embrace a healthy lifestyle. Through sport-based activities
and events, students develop the knowledge, skills and values needed to
lead healthy lifestyles. Their development is monitored through both theoretical
and practical assessments. The department also places an emphasis on modular
games assessments and quizzes as they evaluate students’ knowledge and
skills acquisition. The National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) test is
conducted as a means to assess the students’ fitness in various components.</p>
<p><strong>Our Programmes</strong>
<br><strong>1. Secondary One Adventure Camp and Secondary Three Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) Challenge</strong>
<br>These outdoor adventure camps serve as platforms for students to learn
independence, to challenge their abilities, and to build camaraderie and
teamwork.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sports Enrichment Programme</strong>
<br>This programme introduces students to novel sports and activities such
as golfing, bowling and Kin-ball, thereby enriching their experiences and
promoting class bonding.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sports Fiesta</strong>
<br>The Sports Fiesta includes track events, the Captain’s Ball Competition
for Secondary One students and the Frisbee Competition for Secondary Two
students. These activities allow students to showcase their talents while
learning to work in teams through competitive events.</p>
