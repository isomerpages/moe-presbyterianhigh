<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>PresHighians as critical thinkers and independent, passionate learners
who explore, imagine and create opportunities to bless the community.</p>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>The various units in the department develop curricula that promote active
learning processes. This includes the use of the design thinking protocol
in Design and Technology, inquiry-based learning in Art, performance-based
learning in Music and Nutrition and Food Science, project-based learning
in Economics, and collaborative learning in Accounting.</p>
<p>Connecting students to real-world issues, problems and applications allows
the department to create more meaningful learning experiences for all PresHighians.</p>
<h3>Our Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>1. Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>To inculcate an inquisitive mindset in our students, we plan learning
journeys to offer opportunities for exploration, wonder and extension of
learning.</p>
<p><strong>2. Collaboration with the Community</strong>
</p>
<p>Our annual collaboration with the National Organ Transplant Unit provides
a platform for Art enthusiasts to make a positive impact on and to bless
the community.</p>
<p>Participation in various competitions organised in the various subjects
including Art, Design &amp; Technology, Nutrition and Food Science (NFS),
and Principles of Accounting (POA) extends learning opportunities for students
beyond the curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>3. Celebrate Learning Together</strong>
</p>
<p>This event is a showcase of our studentsâ€™ achievements and learning processes,
aimed to encourage and affirm their efforts.</p>
