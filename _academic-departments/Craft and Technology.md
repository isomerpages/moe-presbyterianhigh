# Our Vision

PresHighians as critical thinkers and independent, passionate learners who explore, imagine and create opportunities to bless the community

<h3>Our Approach</h3>

The various units in the department develop curricula that promote active learning processes. This includes the use of the design thinking protocol in Design and Technology, inquiry-based learning in Art, performance-based learning in Music and Nutrition and Food Science, project-based learning in Economics, and collaborative learning in Accounting.

Connecting students to real-world issues, problems and applications allows the department to create more meaningful learning experiences for all PresHighians.

<h3>Our Programmes</h3>

**1. Learning Journeys**

To inculcate an inquisitive mindset in our students, we plan learning journeys to offer opportunities for exploration, wonder and extension of learning.

**2. Collaboration with the Community**

Our annual collaboration with the National Organ Transplant Unit provides a platform for Art enthusiasts to make a positive impact on and to bless the community.

Participation in various competitions organised in the various subjects including Art, Design &amp; Technology, Nutrition and Food Science (NFS), and Principles of Accounting (POA) extends learning opportunities for students beyond the curriculum.

**3. Celebrate Learning Together**

This event is a showcase of our studentsâ€™ achievements and learning processes, aimed to encourage and affirm their efforts.
