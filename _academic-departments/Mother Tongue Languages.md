<h2>Our Vision</h2>

Students who stay rooted while embracing the future

<h3>Our Approach</h3>


The Mother Tongue Languages Department is dedicated to nurturing the love for Mother Tongue languages while equipping students to be proficient and confident communicators in the 21st century.

  

母语部致力于培养学生成为21世纪热爱各自母语文化并能够自信地在日常生活中利用母语进行交际互动的学习者。

  

In our classes, we seek to build a strong foundation for students in their respective Mother Tongue languages so that they can be proficient and confident in their communication. Beyond the classroom, we organise activities aimed at nurturing a love for our rich heritage and cultures. This helps our students to appreciate their ethnic identities and remain firmly rooted.

  

<h3>Our Programmes</h3>

  

**1\. Journalism Programme**

Our Journalism Programme provides students with opportunities to hone and practise their journalistic skills and report writing. Additionally, the programme guides students through the process of developing effective questioning techniques and enhances their oratorical skills.

  

**2\. Reading Programme**

Conducted on Fridays, our Reading Programme aims to enrich students’ vocabulary, boosting confidence in both their writing and conversational skills. This programme also fosters a greater awareness and appreciation of the use of their Mother Tongue language, incorporating materials, such as newspapers, novels and short stories.

  

**3\. Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight**&nbsp;

MTL Fortnight seeks to create an immersive environment for students to learn and appreciate their Mother Tongue language and culture. Different themes are explored each year to provide a diverse learning experience for our students.

  

4\. Cultural Festivities

We provide platforms for students to develop their presentation skills about various cultural festivities, such as Chinese New Year and Hari Raya Pausa. In the process, students gain insights into the celebrations of different cultures.&nbsp;

  

5\. Competitions

The MTL Department involves our students in a range of diverse competitions that sharpen students’ language skills. These include the:

*   Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) Malay Language Fiesta “1, 2, 3, Aksi!” Skit Competition
