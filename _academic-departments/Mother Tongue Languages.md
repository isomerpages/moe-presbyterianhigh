# **Mother Tongue Languages**

Mother Tongue Languages Department

The Mother Tongue Languages Department seeks to nurture the love for Mother Tongue languages and equip students to be proficient and confident communicators for the 21st century.

### Our programmes

Extensive Reading Programme

The Extensive Reading Programme seeks to cultivate the habit of reading in students by exposing them to various genres of writing as well as to provide a platform for students to formulate opinions and engage in discussion on contemporary issues. Every Thursday, students read a Mother Tongue Language book, the “Comma” magazine for students taking Chinese Language or the “Gen-G” newspapers for students taking Malay Language.

“I think that the reading programme is great as it gives me the opportunity to read different types of Malay reading materials like books and newspapers.” - Muhammad Afiq Naufal

“I enjoy the Silent Reading period on Thursday mornings. The 20-minute reading period gives me the time and space to read my Chinese books and magazines.” - Ryan Oh

**Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Fortnight**

MTL Fortnight aims to create an immersive environment for the learning and appreciation of Mother Tongue languages and culture. Through participating in activities like Chinese face mask painting, Peranakan tiles painting, Malay kite (wau) making and Traditional Chinese Medicine appreciation, students gain better insights to the culture and traditions of the Chinese and Malay communities respectively.
