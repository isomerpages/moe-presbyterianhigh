Mother Tongue Languages Department

The Mother Tongue Languages Department seeks to nurture the love for Mother Tongue languages and equip students to be proficient and confident communicators for the 21st century.

### Our programmes

Extensive Reading Programme

The Extensive Reading Programme seeks to cultivate the habit of reading in students by exposing them to various genres of writing as well as to provide a platform for students to formulate opinions and engage in discussion on contemporary issues. Every Thursday, students read a Mother Tongue Language book, the “Comma” magazine for students taking Chinese Language or the “Gen-G” newspapers for students taking Malay Language.
