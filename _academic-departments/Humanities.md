<h3>Our Vision</h3>

  

Thinkers with a Heart, Advocating for a World of Positive Change

  

<h3>Our Approach</h3>

  

The Humanities Department envisions a world where the Humanities subjects empower our youth to champion positive change in the world. With this guiding philosophy, our teachers transform the Humanities classroom into a creative and meaningful space for students to investigate real-world issues, fostering a sense of empathy and a deeper appreciation for the world around us. Authentic learning tasks are also designed to ignite passion and confidence in every Humanities learner.

  

To empower our students to be reflective thinkers and confident, self-directed learners, we craft extended learning opportunities for our students.These include learning journeys, field trips, competitions and national seminars – all of which are designed to unlock their full potential.

  

**Our Programmes**

  

**1\. Signature Programme: Humanities Immersion Programme (HIP)**

  

The Humanities Immersion Programme (HIP) brings together a passionate group of upper secondary students who share a common goal: to explore and delve deeper into issues related to the three pillars of Sustainability – Social, Environmental and Economic. Issues that our students seek to address include the erosion of Singapore’s cultural heritage, land utilisation, the impact of fast fashion, inclusivity for people with disabilities, and the challenges posed by climate change.

  

**2\. External Competitions and Conferences**

  

We place a strong emphasis on stretching our students’ potential, and we firmly believe that learning from their peers in other secondary schools is an invaluable experience. Our students participate in various national competitions that encourage the exchange of ideas and perspectives, including:

*   the National Youth Environment Conference,&nbsp;
    
*   the ASEAN Symposium for Secondary School Students,
    
*   the MOE History Challenge, and
    
*   the NUS Geography Challenge.
   
  

**3\. Learning Beyond the Classroom**


Learning experiences beyond the classroom provide our students with authentic opportunities to connect what they have read in textbooks to the real world. These experiences enrich our students’ understanding of the subjects they study and their relevance to appreciating the world around them. They include:&nbsp;

*   upcycling workshops,
    
*   visits to vertical farms,&nbsp;
    
*   financial literacy workshops,&nbsp;
    
*   learning journeys to Gardens by the Bay, and&nbsp;
    
*   guided tours of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
