<img align="right" style="width:280px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;" src="/images/image001-1.jpg">

The PHS Humanities Department imagines a world where the Humanities subjects empower our youths to champion for positive changes in the world. With this philosophy guiding the teachers, the Humanities classroom becomes a creative and meaningful space for students as they investigate real-world issues that allow them to develop a sense of empathy and appreciation for the world around us. We carry out authentic learning tasks that seek to ignite passion and build confidence in each and every Humanities learner.

### **Humanities in the Everyday Classroom**

No longer is the Humanities education about memorisation of facts and content.&nbsp;

Instead, it revolves around understanding societal problems and world issues.

The PHS Humanities Department imagines a world where the Humanities subjects (Social Studies, History and Geography) empower our youths to champion for positive changes in the world. With this philosophy guiding the Humanities teachers, the Humanities classroom is evolving into a more creative and meaningful space for students as they investigate real-world issues that allow them to develop a sense of empathy and appreciation for the world around us. Our conventional pen-and-paper assessment modes are also shifting to authentic tasks that seek to bring out the passion and confidence in each and every Humanities learner.

### Our Programmes

Humanities Talent Development Programme

‘Thinkers with a Heart, Advocating for a World of Positive Change.’&nbsp;

The Humanities Talent Development Programme (HTDP) aims to develop students to be the voice of Humanities. We attune students to look at contemporary issues from multiple lenses, think critically and generate human-centric viable solutions. These opportunities exposed students to authentic experiences related to the Humanities as they become global citizens who are able to speak for Humanities for the past, present and future.

“Before the Insectta Farm Visit, I was quite skeptical and scared because naturally I would be afraid and squeamish when faced with an insect. Through the patience and encouragement of the person-in-charge, Kai, I felt confident enough to hold the black soldier fly in my hands, and touch the larvae. I learnt that I should try my best to change my mentality towards insects and be more open-minded when I see them as they really help us economically, medically and environmentally. The learning journey was more exciting than I thought it would have been. This was a very eye-opening experience and I am very grateful that I have gone for it!” - Ganesh Shukvir

“I feel that the National Youth Environmental Challenge (NYEC) has benefitted me a lot as it allowed me to experience what it is like and how stressful it feels in a Modern United Nations (MUN) Conference. I have also gained valuable insights on how to write a position paper, the various ways of yielding and the motions that are to be called in the debate. In addition, the debate really pushed me out of my comfort zone as I have to work with others outside our school and communicate with them. I have learnt a lot and made many new friends from other schools too, so I would love to join such a conference again if given the opportunity.” - Lionel Toh

**Geography**

<img align="right" style="width:300px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;" src="/images/1%20(1).png">

To provide an experiential, values-driven and authentic education, every year, Geography students undergo the process of conducting at least a Geographical Investigation (GI). GI offers students first-hand experience of carrying out fieldwork and develops their 21st Century Competencies. As part of our aim to enhance the spatial and digital literacy of our students, we introduce to our students the science and digital language of location through Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology for their geographical investigation.

**History**

<img align="right" style="width:300px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;" src="/images/2xx.jpg">

The studying of history enables students to think critically about timeless concepts such as cause and effect, changes and continuities and significance. Historical Investigation is an integral part of the History curriculum. It serves as a platform for students to investigate different aspects of Singapore's history. Lower Secondary students get the opportunity to gather and explore a range of sources such as artefacts, written, pictorial as well as oral sources beyond what they are exposed in classroom. They will get to do 'history' by carrying out research and apply their historical knowledge and skills to form their own response to authentic historical issue.

**Social Studies**

<img align="right" style="width:300px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;" src="/images/3xx.jpg">

In-line with our school's termly focus of Caring for the Environment, Secondary 3 students carry out an issue investigation on two environmental issues that are a major cause of concern to Singapore - Food Wastage and Plastic Consumption. Students gather data to find out how and why these issues can become a cause of social concern to Singapore when they are not managed. Thereafter, students either create an advocacy video or a poster for the environmental issue that their group choses. For the advocacy videos, our students take on the roles of the various stakeholders involved in the environmental issues. They provide perspectives and recommendations from their chosen roles, and in the process, develop skills and values that cannot be assessed through pen-and-paper assessment. These skills are also part of the Upper Secondary Social Studies syllabus where students learn to make recommendations to address societal issues.


### Signature Programme –&nbsp;The Humanities Immersion Programme (HIP)

The HIP students are a group of passionate 15 to 16-year-olds who have come together to delve deeper into issues on the three pillars of sustainability: social, environmental and economic. These include&nbsp;the erosion of Singapore’s cultural heritage, land use, fast fashion, inclusivity of people with disabilities and climate change. Students&nbsp;dream of advocating for positive changes and making a difference to the society.&nbsp;

Using their knowledge from the composting workshop, the HIP participants organised a kokedama-making workshop for students of ASPN Chaoyang School during our joint National Day celebrations.&nbsp;  

  

“I learnt that a sustainable lifestyle can be easily attained by integrating a few good habits into our daily lives. Before participating in the HIP camp, I felt like I had no way to contribute to sustainability as an individual. However, after the camp, I felt more hopeful about my own ability to contribute to sustainability.”

&nbsp;- Law En Yu, participant of HIP camp 2022

  

### Learning Beyond the Classroom&nbsp;

  

Students embark on extended learning opportunities like learning journeys, fieldtrips, competitions and national seminars to build their confidence and hone their reflective and independent thinking skills.&nbsp;

  

**External Competitions and Conferences**&nbsp;

Every year, Humanities students are given the opportunity to take part in national competitions and conferences, during which students learn from other secondary school students. This learning experience is invaluable.&nbsp;

  

Some platforms include:&nbsp;

* National Youth Environment Conference&nbsp;
* ASEAN Symposium&nbsp;
* MOE History Challenge&nbsp;
* NUS Geography Challenge&nbsp;
* The Sustainable Singapore Gallery “Speak Up, Voice Out 2022” – Letters to Our Planet

Eileen Teng from 4 Grace and Chloe Choo from 4 Faith won Best Position Paper on the theme of “Sustainable Living” in the National Youth Environment Conference 2022.&nbsp;  

  

“The overall experience was quite interesting and I learnt more about climate change as well as how other countries are managing it better than from lessons itself. The committee sessions were in truth, quite stressful, as we had to debate with others and prove how feasible our solutions were. Nonetheless, I’m glad to have joined it. It broadened my horizon as I watched in awe at others who were able to debate very well.” - Shun Le Hnin, participant of NYEC 2022  

  

**ASEAN Symposium**&nbsp;

In the ASEAN Symposium 2022, our students presented their paper on the prevalence of slums in ASEAN and shared their groups’ recommendations on tackling the issue of slums in countries like the Philippines and Thailand.

“I am glad I was given this opportunity to learn about our country’s needs, and how we, as a nation, can stay united with other countries as our partners.”&nbsp;– Georgina Koh Yu Xin, Participant of ASEAN Symposium 2022
