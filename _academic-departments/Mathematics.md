# **Mathematics**

The Mathematics Department aims to cultivate interest in and appreciation of Mathematics. The subject helps students understand real-world phenomena and provides the foundation for many innovations and solutions. We seek to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies, and stretch their capacities to think logically, critically and analytically. 

### Our Programmes

**PHS Mathematics Olympiad** 
  
We have started our very own PHS Mathematics Olympiad for the Secondary One cohort to develop and stretch students who show keen interest in and display potential in mathematical problem solving.

“I totally enjoy solving the challenging Mathematical questions during the Mathematics Olympiad. I was given practice questions to work on as preparation for the Olympiad. Though the questions were challenging, I truly enjoyed the challenge!” - Fan Yu Xuan

“I enjoyed the Mathematics Olympiad as I was exposed to Mathematical concepts beyond what I learnt in my Mathematics lessons.” - Andrew Tan Chin Yang
