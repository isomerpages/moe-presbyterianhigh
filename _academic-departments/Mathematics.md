# **Mathematics**

The Mathematics Department aims to cultivate interest in and appreciation of Mathematics. The subject helps students understand real-world phenomena and provides the foundation for many innovations and solutions. We seek to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies, and stretch their capacities to think logically, critically and analytically. 

### Our Programmes

**PHS Mathematics Olympiad** 
  
We have started our very own PHS Mathematics Olympiad for the Secondary One cohort to develop and stretch students who show keen interest in and display potential in mathematical problem solving.
