# **Mathematics Department**&nbsp;


The Mathematics Department cultivates students' interest in and their appreciation of Mathematics and equips them with necessary knowledge, skills and competencies to think logically, critically and analytically. The study of Mathematics helps students understand real-world phenomena and provides the&nbsp;foundation for many innovations and solutions.&nbsp;

**Learning Mathematics beyond the Classroom**

Sparking students' interest in trigonometry&nbsp;

**Our signature programmes include:**&nbsp;

*   Mathematics Olympiad training for Sec 1 to 3 students, which hones students' mathematical problem solving skills;
*   Problem-Based Learning (PBL) projects, which develop creative and critical thinking, collaborative, and problem-solving skills in Sec 2 student. Students conduct research, use technology in design exploration and collaborate to propose a solution to real-world problems;&nbsp;
*   Mathematics Week, which promotes a positive attitude towards Mathematics and develops the joy of learning.

  

**PHS Mathematics Olympiad**&nbsp;   
PHS Mathematics Olympiad develops Secondary One students who show keen interest in and display potential in mathematical problem solving.

**Problem-Based Learning (PBL)**  
PBL develops our students' creative and critical thinking, collaborative and problem-solving skills. Students work in groups to formulate goals and set learning objectives on the topic of Mensuration to solve a given real-world problem. The students conduct research online, use Microsoft Excel for the design exploration stage, and collaborate through the SLS to propose a solution to the problem.
