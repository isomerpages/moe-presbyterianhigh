<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>Every PresHighian a resilient problem solver who is self-directed and
has an appreciation for Mathematics</p>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>To develop effective problem solvers who can skilfully apply mathematical
knowledge and procedures, we emphasise learning experiences that deepen
conceptual understanding, strengthen mathematical skills and processes,
and simultaneously foster 21st-century competencies in our students.</p>
<p>Through purposeful questioning and scaffolding, we create opportunities
for students to engage in mathematical discussions with both their peers
and teachers. As students communicate, reason and articulate their thought
processes, they develop critical thinking skills and deepen their grasp
of mathematical concepts. Students are also guided to make connections
and apply what they learn in Mathematics to real world contexts. This,
in turn, helps our students appreciate the relevance and power of mathematics,
while kindling the joy of learning in the mathematics classroom.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of our approach is in building an inclusive and supportive
learning environment that promotes collaborative learning. We encourage
students to take ownership of their learning and persevere towards achieving
success.</p>
<h3>Our Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>1. Math Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Math Day is an annual event that engages students in hands-on activities,
designed to deepen their appreciation of mathematics and enable them to
recognise the presence of mathematics in the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>2. PHS Mathematics Olympiad Preparatory Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme is designed to stretch the capabilities of Secondary One
students who exhibit a keen interest in and the potential for mathematical
problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>3. Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO) Training</strong>
</p>
<p>SMO Training is a programme designed to impart advanced mathematical concepts
to selected Secondary Two to Four students, while developing in them creative
mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
