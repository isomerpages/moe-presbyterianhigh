# **Physical Education and Aesthetics**

The Physical Education (PE) Unit aims to develop students’ knowledge and skills to enable them to lead active and healthy lives. Eight core sports modules have been incorporated into our PE curriculum. They include basketball, volleyball, badminton, football, softball, table tennis, handball and floorball. There are also opportunities for students to engage in team sports, allowing them to develop resilience, teamwork, inclusivity and other 21st century competencies. 


“I enjoy PE lessons. Not only is it engaging, it also helps to develop my motor skills, strengthen my muscles and cultivate potential hobbies.” - Ariel The

“Learning sports is exciting as some of us are not exposed to different types of sports outside of school. I enjoy learning the rules and game play techniques of sports games like basketball and badminton. - Mohammed Fiqri Bin Mohammed Firman

 “Learning sports in PE has not only helped me understand different sports better. It has also strengthened my bonds with my classmates as we played in teams during team sports modules.” - Jong Lixuan
