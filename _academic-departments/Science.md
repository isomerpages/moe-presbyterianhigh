# **Science**

The Science Department seeks opportunities to inculcate a spirit of scientific inquiry in our students, grow their scientific literacy and excite them to pursue STEM-related endeavours. Our students are exposed to an array of programmes and activities, to enrich their learning experiences and connect theoretical knowledge to real-life situations in authentic settings.

### Our Programmes  

Sec 1 Project Work  

The Sec 1 Project Work is a learning experience that aims to provide students with the opportunity to synthesise knowledge from various areas such as the nature of science and scientific inquiry skills, and apply to real life situations. In groups, the students select a topic and go through the Scientific Inquiry process – identifying a problem, conduct an investigation, gather and interpret data and communicate their findings. Through the process, students acquire skills such as collaboration, communication and self-directed learning.

  

“From Science project work, I have learnt that there are many ways to solve problems while working together. All my group members had different solutions to the problems that we faced. Instead of insisting on wanting things done our way, we negotiated and decided on the best possible solution. Looking at things from different perspectives resulted in a better, more creative project. It was an enriching experience for all of us.” - Anshika Banerjee

“I enjoyed working on the Science project with my group mates because not only can we learn various Science concepts from the experiments, we also had lots of fun. My group created an aluminium foil boat. Although we had a few small laboratory “disasters”, we really enjoyed the entire process of learning.” - Tay Jingxuan

"The Science project work was very interesting and it was something different from the usual Science lessons. My group chose to design an aluminium foil boat that could carry the heaviest load. We carried out
many experiments with boats of varying shapes and sizes. Overall, it was very fun and I hope to be able to do it again.” - Ashley Chong
