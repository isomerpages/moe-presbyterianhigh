# **Science**

We inculcate in students the spirit of scientific inquiry and the quest to innovate and&nbsp;generate creative solutions to solve real-world problems. Learning experiences are provided for students to strengthen their conceptual understanding, integrate practice with theory and facilitate interdisciplinary connections across the Sciences. We believe that, when our students acquire a strong foundation in Science, they will be equipped to pursue STEM-related endeavors in future.
