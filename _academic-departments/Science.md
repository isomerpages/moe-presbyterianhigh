<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>Every PresHighian a passionate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering
and Math) learner who endeavours to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Curious: Finds out how STEM knowledge and skills are relevant to the world
around them,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creative: Applies STEM concepts and generates ideas to solve real-world
problems,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Change: Solves problems using STEM to serve the community and to better
society.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>Our science curriculum is committed to providing students with diverse
learning experiences and assessment methods. We emphasise the application
of scientific knowledge to understand and solve real-world problems in
a global context. This approach strengthens the integration of theory and
practical application, exemplified by projects such as the water filtration
project undertaken by all our Secondary One students. This hands-on project
not only reinforces theoretical knowledge but also encourages students
to apply their learning in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>We embrace a two-pronged approach to challenge and stretch our students.
The first approach centres around our Talent Development Programme, aimed
at nurturing excellence and honing the skills of our high-achieving students
in various STEM disciplines. This programme provides opportunities for
these students to delve deeper into their chosen fields, engaging in advanced
prototyping and research. The second approach involves actively engaging
and exploring learning opportunities with various interest groups.&nbsp;
This includes learning journeys and applied learning modules that allow
students to gain practical skills and knowledge beyond the classroom.</p>
<h3>Our Programmes</h3>
<p>1. <u>Talent Development Programme</u>
<br>Students get a chance to participate in various science events, including
the Singapore International STEM Innovation Challenge (SISTEMIC) for Lower
Secondary students, the Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad for Upper Secondary
students, the Youth STEM Empowerment Programme (YSEP), and the Research
&amp; Development Experience Programme (R&amp;DEP).</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. <u>Interest-based Programmes</u>
<br>Our students are also involved in interest-based programmes that aim to
make STEM education more exciting, relevant and accessible to students,
encouraging them to explore their interest in Science. Some of these activities
include the Scientist-in-School Programme, Work Attachment to the Genome
Institute of Singapore, the Art and Science Pharmaceutical Compounding
Applied Learning Module at Republic Polytechnic, and the Chemistry Escape
Room.</p>
