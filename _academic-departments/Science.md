# **Science**

The Science Department seeks opportunities to inculcate a spirit of scientific inquiry in our students, grow their scientific literacy and excite them to pursue STEM-related endeavours. Our students are exposed to an array of programmes and activities, to enrich their learning experiences and connect theoretical knowledge to real-life situations in authentic settings.

### Our Programmes  

**Sec 1 Project Work ** 

The Sec 1 Project Work is a learning experience that aims to provide students with the opportunity to synthesise knowledge from various areas such as the nature of science and scientific inquiry skills, and apply to real life situations. In groups, the students select a topic and go through the Scientific Inquiry process – identifying a problem, conduct an investigation, gather and interpret data and communicate their findings. Through the process, students acquire skills such as collaboration, communication and self-directed learning.

  
“From Science project work, I have learnt that there are many ways to solve problems while working together. All my group members had different solutions to the problems that we faced. Instead of insisting on wanting things done our way, we negotiated and decided on the best possible solution. Looking at things from different perspectives resulted in a better, more creative project. It was an enriching experience for all of us.” - Anshika Banerjee

“I enjoyed working on the Science project with my group mates because not only can we learn various Science concepts from the experiments, we also had lots of fun. My group created an aluminium foil boat. Although we had a few small laboratory “disasters”, we really enjoyed the entire process of learning.” - Tay Jingxuan

"The Science project work was very interesting and it was something different from the usual Science lessons. My group chose to design an aluminium foil boat that could carry the heaviest load. We carried out
many experiments with boats of varying shapes and sizes. Overall, it was very fun and I hope to be able to do it again.” - Ashley Chong

**Secondary 2 Case-based Studies**

In our case-based studies, students are given excerpts of patients’ medical information to work on, which provide them with an authentic and novel context. Collaboratively, they apply their learning and present their findings. Through applying their knowledge to real-world scenarios, the students demonstrate understanding, sharpen their critical thinking skills, and develop their scientific communication skills. 

“During case-based study, my team members and I discussed alternative points of views openly. We considered all perspectives and worked together in order to reach a conclusion. I liked this mode of learning.” - Cheng Zee Yee George

 “The case-based study was a fun and interesting activity as I got to interact with my group mates to analyse the different types of real-life statistics to figure out the disease/ illness the patient was suffering from. It was a very enjoyable collaborative process.” - Ang Pei Xuan Christabella

“While participating in the case-based studies, I came across new scientific concepts which I found very interesting. I had a fun time working with my group members to evaluate the data and then produce a deck of slides to explain to our patient his health issue. With my newfound knowledge, if I were to come across someone with similar symptoms, I could enlighten him on their health condition.” - Wong Kar Hong
