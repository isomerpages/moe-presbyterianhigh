The PHS Teaching & Learning (T&L) Framework draws from two main sources: key areas of performance in teaching explored in Saphier, Haley-Speca and Gower’s The Skillful Teacher, and the dimensions of teaching and learning in the Singapore Teaching Practice. The framework describes clear expectations for learning and guides teaching practices to support effective learning. 

At the core of this T&L Framework lies a learner-centered approach. It takes into account the differences in learners and focuses on each learner’s interests, abilities, readiness level and learning style in order to promote the highest level of motivation and achievement. It puts the responsibility for learning in the hands of the learners by imparting them with the knowledge and skills to carry out independent and lifelong learning. To this end, learning is facilitated through the use of appropriate teaching pedagogy, curriculum delivered and assessment tools.
