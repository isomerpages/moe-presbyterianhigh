# **PHS Teaching and Learning Framework**

  **PHS Teaching and Learning (T&L) Framework**

The PHS T&L Framework draws from the key areas of performance in teaching explored in The Skillful Teacher and the dimensions of teaching and learning in the Singapore Teaching Practice. It describes clear expectations for learning as well as guides teaching practices to support effective learning. 

Learner-centered approach is the core of the PHS T&L Framework.  It takes into account the differences in learners and focuses on each learner’s interests, abilities, readiness and learning style to promote the highest level of motivation and achievement. It puts the responsibility for learning in the hands of the learners by imparting them with the knowledge and skills to carry out independent and lifelong learning. To this end, learning is facilitated through the use of appropriate teaching pedagogy, curriculum delivered and assessment tools.
