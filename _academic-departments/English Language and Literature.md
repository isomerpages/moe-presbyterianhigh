# **English Language and Literature**

English Language and Literature Department

The English Language and Literature Department seeks to develop PHS students into effective communicators and discerning readers who are able to evaluate real-word issues empathetically and critically. We empower our students to use language purposefully to make a difference to their immediate community and beyond.    

### Our Programmes

**Extensive Reading Programme**

The Extensive Reading Programme cultivates the love of reading in students. The programme comprises Newspaper Reading on Mondays and Silent Reading of various genres of writing on Tuesdays and Fridays during the morning assembly. It runs throughout the year to support the acquisition of language skills. In addition, newspaper reading opens up the minds of the students to see beyond their world, to explore a gamut of social and global concerns. Reading Ambassadors are appointed in all English classes to facilitate and champion a culture of reading in PHS through regular book sharing sessions at the class and school level.
