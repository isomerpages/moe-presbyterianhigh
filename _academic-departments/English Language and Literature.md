# **English Language and Literature**

The English Language and Literature Department nurtures effective communicators and discerning readers, who are able to evaluate real-world issues empathetically and critically. We empower our students to use language purposefully to make a difference to their community and beyond**.**&nbsp;

**Our Approach**&nbsp;

We aim to make learning joyful and relevant for students. In the acquisition of listening, reading, speaking and writing skills, students are exposed to a wide range of texts, e.g., audio, visual and linguistic. Students are given opportunities to collaborate and showcase what they have learnt.

Students design book covers to show an appreciation for the characters and themes of a text.

### Our Programmes

**Extensive Reading Programme**

The Extensive Reading Programme cultivates the love of reading in students. The programme comprises Newspaper Reading on Mondays and Silent Reading of various genres of writing on Tuesdays and Fridays during the morning assembly. It runs throughout the year to support the acquisition of language skills. In addition, newspaper reading opens up the minds of the students to see beyond their world, to explore a gamut of social and global concerns. Reading Ambassadors are appointed in all English classes to facilitate and champion a culture of reading in PHS through regular book sharing sessions at the class and school level.




_"What I enjoy most about the Silent Reading period is being able to read my book in a quiet and calm environment in the morning.” - Naomi Maiyanti_

_“I enjoy the Silent Reading period because I can let my imagination flow when I read in class in the morning. The classroom is very quiet and I find it very conducive to read. Reading allows me to expand my vocabulary. I am also more well-informed of current affairs, as I get to read the newspapers every Monday during the Silent Reading period.” - Aliyah Carlyn Lerio Jarque_  
  

_“I enjoy the Silent Reading Period as it gives me the opportunity to keep myself updated on current affairs as well as spend more time on reading the books that I enjoy.” - Caleb Ng Wei En_

**Local Authors’ e-Talk**

The Local Author’s e-Talk provides our Upper Secondary students with the opportunity to meet with writers whose works they are studying, and ask them questions.

“It was interesting to know the producer and authors’ own perceptions and interpretations of their own characters, especially the reasons for the nameless and faceless main characters of both “Rich Man Country” and “Margarine”. I enjoyed their sharing on how they came about to writing their stories. At the end of the session, I felt inspired to write my own stories and happy that I got an inside to the authors to help me better understand the texts.” - Heng Mei Ling_

“The writer’s talk helped me to understand the short stories in Hook &amp; Eye: Stories from the Margins and provided me a new perspective to these stories. The talk also got me to think more about the questions and the thought processes of marginalised communities and understand from their perspectives. This talk is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will cherish.” - Heidi Yung

“The Sing Lit talk was very insightful because I learnt more about the various authors of the stories. I also have the opportunity to delve deeper into what Singapore Literature is. This makes me more equipped in understanding the stories in Hook &amp; Eye when I analyse them next year.” - Ilaga Danielle Aguilar

**National Schools Literature Festival**

Our Literature students participate in the National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) annually. Through NSLF, students are enthused and inspired to read Literature; develop confidence in articulating their opinions and viewpoints in public; and gain fresh perspectives of the literary text they are reading.

**Our approach**

Our approach to the teaching of English Language and Literature aims at making learning joyful and relevant for students.

In the acquisition of listening, reading, speaking and writing skills, students are exposed to a wide range of texts i.e. audio, images, multimodal. We strive to develop students into multiliterate individuals who possess the necessary skills to navigate the world beyond school. Students are given opportunities to showcase what they have learnt and at the same time, collaborate with one another on multimodal projects. In the collaborative process, students learn how to manage differences, work towards shared objectives and see the project to completion.

Our English Language and Literature curriculum has a strong focus on developing students’ thinking skills. Teachers model thinking processes and leverage thinking routines to empower students to strengthen and regulate their learning.

We believe that the learning of language and literature is deepened through talk. In the classroom, students are given time and opportunity to engage in exploratory talk and inquiry through dialogue to co-construct new knowledge. As they present their thoughts and views to others, they build their confidence by speaking in front of an audience.

We leverage technology in the English Language and Literature classroom to enhance students’ learning. Apart from collaborating online and engaging in self-directed learning, students also benefit from rich and authentic learning experiences. They go on local and overseas virtual tours and participate in e-drama activities.
