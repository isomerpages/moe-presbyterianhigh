 <h3>Our Vision</h3>

Every PresHighian a proficient communicator capable of expressing thoughts and feelings with empathy, creativity and impact

  

<h3>Our Approach</h3>
 

In this digital era, we deem it important to develop students’ critical and creative thinking skills. In our English Language and Literature classrooms, we assume the role of facilitators of learning, leveraging technology to craft opportunities for our students to read, view, speak and write.

We introduce our students to a wide array of texts, including multimodal ones, and make our own thinking visible to guide their comprehension. We offer numerous platforms for inquiry, collaboration and group presentations, both in small settings and to larger audiences. Through this approach, students not only feel greater engagement but also gain a deeper appreciation of the nuances of language. The diverse perspectives they encounter enable them to reevaluate their beliefs and biases, fostering empathy.

Students who exhibit a keen interest and aptitude in the language are given opportunities to participate in enrichment programmes and competitions to further develop their passion and stretch their abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;
