# **Lifeskills and Enterprise**

The Life Skills and Enterprise Department is made up of the Art Unit, the Design and Technology Unit, the Nutrition and Food Science Unit, and the Economics and Principles of Accounts Unit. Together, we seek to develop our students into critical thinkers and independent learners who possess a growth mindset. We hope that our students will be ever exploring, imagining and creating to bless the community. 

  

**Art Unit**    
Every year, the Art Unit takes part in the Live On Festival (LOF), an initiative by the National Organ Transplant Unit (NOTU) at the Ministry of Health. LOF provides a good platform for our Art students to express their thoughts on organ donation and transplantation creatively. In the process, our students interact with organ failure patients and hear their stories before working on their artwork submission. The artwork serves as an outreach to educate the community on organ transplant and donation.

**Design and Technology Unit**   
The Design and Technology curriculum adopts the Design Thinking Process as one of the key pedagogical approaches. Projects are designed to align with the school’s termly focus on social issues. In the process of carrying out research and working on their projects, our students develop critical thinking and problem solving skills to make the community a better place.

“I find Design and Technology lessons very interesting. I love the hands-on sessions and I look forward to the workshop sessions where I can construct and build the prototype of what I have designed. Though the process can be difficult, I told myself that I have to be determined to see to the completion of my product.” Aiko Kitazawa

  
  

**Nutrition and Food Science Unit**   
The Nutrition and Food Science Unit seeks to make Learning relevant and authentic for students. We guide students to apply the principles of culinary science in food preparation, so that they can lead healthier lifestyles through a balanced diet.

"I really enjoyed the entire process of making the quiche. I can’t wait to share the recipe with my family and make it together with them. I am sure that we will have a lot of fun making it."- Teoh Yi Ting

“FCE lessons are fun! I have learnt how to make better food choices and the effects a nutritional deficit diet would have on my body." - Jayden Woo

"I wish I could have more FCE lessons so that I could make more delicious food and pick up more culinary skills. I have learnt about vitamins and minerals and what would happen if I do not consume enough of them.  I have also learnt about different cooking methods." - Justin Low

**Economics and Principles of Accounts Units**      
To inject the element of fun in learning, the Economics and Principles of Accounts (POA) units use games in teaching and learning. The Economics students learn about the concept of a monopoly through the online game, Arctopia, while the POA students strengthen their understanding of accounting theories and concepts through card games.

“I didn’t realise accounting can be learnt in such a fun manner through a card game. The game is simple to play and effective in reinforcing the POA concepts learnt.”
