<h1><strong>DSA STEM</strong></h1>

<h5>DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION (DSA) EXERCISE 2023</h5>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) seeks to broaden our students’ exposure

inspire our students on the beauty of discovery and innovation. We want
to raise the aspiration of students to pursue STEM-related courses and
careers to address challenges of the future. Through hands-on exploration
and discovery, students learn about organic chemistry through soap making
and beeswax wrap making. Students will also get to develop computational
skills through coding with micro:bit. They will apply the design thinking
process and use their computational skills and knowledge to ideate and
design prototypes to solve real-world problems.</p>
