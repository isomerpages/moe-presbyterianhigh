### (5) MOE/School-Based Financial Assistance Scheme

The MOE Financial Assistance (FAS) Application is opened for application for 2023.  

We have attached the MOE FAS criteria eligibility (Pamphlet) and FAS Application Form for submission. All compulsory documents must be submitted together with your completed application form for approval.  
Parents may choose to apply MOE FAS through eFAS ([https://go.gov.sg/moe-efas](https://go.gov.sg/moe-efas)). Both the link for eFAS and hardcopy application form is attached in this notification.

Please submit the completed hardcopy FAS forms and supporting documents at the General Office or via e-FAS link, by 31 Jan 2023 (Tue).

Application strictly via hardcopy form is required for below scenario:

* family with other dependents (Great grandparents, Aunties/Uncles, Cousins and others)
* family with more than 5 children in govt school
* family with more than 4 unmarried children not in govt school
* family with more than 3 grandparents in the household


Note:

If your child is a ComCare recipient, you do not need to submit the application form for MOE FAS as MOE FAS will be auto granted to ComCare beneficiaries.

School reserves the rights to request for any other documents as and when required for the purpose of verifying the income and other status.

Please get ready all softcopy supporting documents to be prepared in advance.

If you have any queries, please contact the school at Tel: 64543722 or you can email us [presbyterian@moe.edu.sg](mailto:presbyterian@moe.edu.sg).
