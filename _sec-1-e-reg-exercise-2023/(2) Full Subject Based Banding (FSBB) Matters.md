# **SECONDARY ONE E-REGISTRATION EXERCISE (2023 COHORT)**

### (2) Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) Matters

Dear Parents/Guardians,  
  

PHS is embarking on Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) in 2023 with our incoming Secondary One cohort. 

Our 2023 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising students from different courses of study. Mixed form classes present more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.

In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.

  

These subjects are:

* Art
* Character and Citizenship Education
* Design and Technology
* Food and Consumer Education
* Music
* Physical Education
  
Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.

English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will continue to be offered at Express Level, N(A) Level, and N(T) Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.


Please exercise your options when you receive a PG message offering subject(s) at more demanding level.  
(This is for eligible students only.) If you would like have more information on subject-based banding, kindly see attached.
