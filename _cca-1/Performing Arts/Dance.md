With a vision to nurture dancers of sound character and disposition, the PHS Dance Society is a values-driven CCA. It aspires to inculcate values of perseverance, self-discipline, commitment and teamwork through dancing and choreography. Through this form of artistic expression, our girls of grace are able to convey and articulate their ideas and emotions creatively. 

“Dance has created numerous memories in my secondary school years. This CCA has definitely pushed me to develop a sense of servant leadership and maturity to guide me in my future endeavours.” - Basal Aime Cervantes

“In my four years as a member of the Dance Society, I have learnt that everyone plays a part in creating a piece that resonates with the audience. I have learnt that it is okay to make mistakes as it gives me the opportunity to learn and grow from it. I have also learnt to never give up and to persevere no matter the struggles. Together with my friends in Dance, we went through thick and thin, and put in our blood, sweat and tears into endless hours of dance practices. Through this, we have created a strong, lifelong bonds.” - Jaimie Toh Jia Ying

“I have learnt and grown throughout my years as a member of the Dance Society. When I first joined the CCA, I had no dance background and I was afraid I would not be able to pick up dancing. However, my fellow dancers and instructor taught me to have confidence. We constantly encouraged each other to press on. Through these years, I have not only learnt how to dance but have also gained values such as team spirit, self-discipline, perseverance, resilience, and respect.” - Zita Wai Jin Han
