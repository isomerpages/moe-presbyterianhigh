**Programmes for Holistic Development**

We believe that student well-being goes beyond academic learning, involving non-academic domains such as Character Building, National Education, Cultural Exposure, and Sports and Aesthetics.

Various Programmes for Holistic Development (PHD) seek to equip students with knowledge and skills to engage with these non-academic domains. These activities also serve as platforms to enhance interaction and communication between students, so as to build bonds and camaraderie.
