# **Character First**

The goal of Character and Citizenship Education is to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens. CCE is central to the 21st Century Competencies Framework. It emphasises the interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for character and citizenship development. The new CCE curriculum shifts our focus from programmes to a common purpose, which includes the alignment of the desired outcomes of CCE to the Desired Outcomes of Education.
