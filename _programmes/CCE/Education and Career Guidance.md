**What is ECG?**

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for the successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social-emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century.
