# **Education and Career Guidance**

**What is ECG?**

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for the successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social-emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century.

**Quality ECG Counselling**

ECG Counsellors are deployed to MOE Secondary and Pre-University Schools, and Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEI) started since mid-2015.

At PHS, our ECG Counsellor, Mr Christopher Tan guides students to make considered decisions based on their interests and strengths so they can contribute meaningfully to society through their future professions. In addition to providing individual and group counselling to students, she organises activities for a holistic Education and Career Guidance (ECG) experience.

If you have ECG related concerns and wish to meet with Mr Tan, he will be available in school every Thursday (Level 2, ECG room) or email him at [ecgcounselling2016@gmail.com](mailto:ecgcounselling2016@gmail.com) to make an appointment. 

**Allied Educator (Learning & Behavioral Support)**

Our specialist supports students with learning needs towards participating in school activities as fully as possible. The students will undergo sessions to learn executive function skills such as self-monitoring, organisation and planning. They will also be taught social and communication skills as well as literacy skills. All these are to equip the students with the necessary skills to cope and manage to learn and to interact with his/her peers daily. Our specialist conducts single or group sessions according to the needs and progress of the students.
