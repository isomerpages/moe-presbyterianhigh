**Character and Citizenship Education** 

The Character and Citizenship Education Programme at PHS seeks to develop good character in every student and develop them into a total person worthy of God and man. Our vision is for every PHS student to put character first, believe in his/her future and love the nation. Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Empathy and Integrity are our core values.

As a mission school, PHS has a strong focus on character building. Besides explicit teaching in curriculum and co-curriculum programmes, students are provided with various opportunities and platforms to engage in experiential learning to better internalise the values. These include the formal curriculum, CF lessons by form teachers, Cyber-Wellness Programme, National Education Programme, Sexuality Education Programme, Student Leadership Programme, Community Youth Leadership Programme, and Form Teacher Period. On top of that, there are discussions of contemporary issues and everyday responsibilities, annual level camps, Co-Curricular activities as well as our scheduled School Assembly, Chapel and Daily Devotion periods.

The National Education Programme focuses on helping students understand their role as citizens of Singapore and what love and commitment to the nation means.  During National Education lessons, our students learn the importance of being responsible to their families, friends and the community. They explore and develop their identity as citizens who feel a sense of belonging to the nation, are aware of current societal issues, and are resilient in the face of challenges.
