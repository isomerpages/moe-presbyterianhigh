# **Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Community and Youth Leadership**

![](/images/llp.jpg)

As a part of the Community Youth Leadership Programme, our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) helps PHS students to deepen values, develop life skills and knowledge, and discover their strengths interests and talents. The LLP plans for the intentional development of student leadership by providing authentic experiences for students to engage the community meaningfully. Students are provided with opportunities to develop their leadership skills through serving the community, planning relevant and meaningful activities for the beneficiaries, and developing empathy for others.  

 The LLP also seeks to support the school’s vision of developing students to be ‘Promise-Keepers, Hope-Builders and Servant-Leaders’. In tandem with the school’s Character First Programme, PHS seeks to harness the potential in every student to be the best that he or she can be.

The LLP is implemented via a three-tiered approach:

Tier 1 – Every class will initiate and plan for a community project.

Tier 2 – Every CCA will initiate and plan for a community project.

Tier 3 – Selected student leaders from various CCAs will participate in a signature overseas community project. 

The LLP collectively develops the mental, physical and emotional wellness of our students to give them a firm foundation, so that they can optimise their performance in their academic pursuits, CCAs and other school activities.
