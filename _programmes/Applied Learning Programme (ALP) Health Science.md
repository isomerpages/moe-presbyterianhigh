# **Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - Health Science**

![](/images/alp.jpg)

Our Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM)-related Applied Learning Programme (ALP) seeks to inspire our Lower Secondary students to discover and create, raising their aspiration to pursue STEM-related courses and careers to address challenges of the future to improve peopleâ€™s lives.

At PHS, our ALP focuses on Health and Food Science. Through authentic learning experiences, we seek to develop 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and problem solving skills in our students. Recognising the importance of coding, we have introduced coding skills within our ALP. Students will first undergo a customised module on block-based coding using micro:bit. They will then design prototypes that seek to address health-related and/or food science-related issues.
