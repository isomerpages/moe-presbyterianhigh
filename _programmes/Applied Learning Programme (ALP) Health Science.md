<h3>Applied Learning Programme: Health and Food Science</h3>

 
<h4>Our Programme</h4>

  

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) enhances all lower secondary students’ engagement with Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics (STEM) through Health and Food Science. Students learn to craft innovative ideas and come up with sustainable and effective solutions for minimising virus transmissions. They also hone computational skills and knowledge as they ideate, code with micro:bit, and design prototypes to solve real-world problems.&nbsp;

  

<h4>Our Approach</h4>

*   Tier 1
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Sec 1 ALP: Health Stewards for Tomorrow
	<br>Tier 1 programmes expose students to organic chemistry and sustainability. Students learn to use the design thinking protocol to create a prototype of a soap product. They then test the efficacy of these products in reducing the transmission of viruses.&nbsp;<br>As part of their entrepreneurial journey, students also harness Artificial Intelligence to create innovative and sustainable packaging designs for their prototypes, e.g., using beeswax wrap.&nbsp;

Sec 2 ALP: Coding to Strengthen Food Security

To support Singapore’s ‘30 by 30’ Green Plan, students apply computational thinking through micro:bit coding and create innovative prototypes. In the process, they collaborate with other students to refine their ideas and address diverse stakeholder needs.&nbsp;

*   Tier 2
    

*   Learning Journeys &amp; STEM Competitions
    

Tier 2 programmes aim to develop students’ passion in STEM through enriching learning journeys and exciting competitions.&nbsp;

  

Learning journeys to A\*STAR Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre forge a deep connection between classroom learning and real-world contexts, and introduce students to emerging technologies in industries and STEM-related careers.&nbsp;

  

Competitions, such as the Swift Explorer Singapore Competition, introduce students to the basics of Swift coding and inspire them to create apps to solve issues that they are passionate about – from helping the elderly and those with food allergies to improving mental wellness.
