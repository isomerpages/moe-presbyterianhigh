**Programmes for Holistic Development**

We believe that student well-being goes beyond academic learning, involving non-academic domains such as Character Building, National Education, Cultural Exposure, and Sports and Aesthetics.

Various Programmes for Holistic Development (PHD) seek to equip students with knowledge and skills to engage with these non-academic domains. These activities also serve as platforms to enhance interaction and communication between students, so as to build bonds and camaraderie.

Over the years, our school has introduced students to a wide range of activities as part of PHD. The Build the Child Programme (BTC) is customised for all students at the start of each semester in the new academic year to help students build their competencies as self-directed learners. The BTC modules aim to give students a platform to build confidence, practice self-management, foster collaborative skills and tap on the resilience of a growth mindset. The programme focuses on four domains: Teacher-Student Relationship, Discipline, School Values, as well as the PHS Teaching and Learning Framework. The design of each module is aligned with the school theme, facilitating a whole school approach to Empower, Enable and Engage our students.

Students in each cohort also enjoy signature programmes such as the Secondary 1 Orientation Camp, Secondary 2 Adventure Camp, the MOE-OBS Programme for Secondary 3 students and the Goal Setting, Learning Plan, Ownership, Wellness or G.L.O.W. Programme for Secondary 4 and 5 students.  

The annual Sports Fiesta aims to promote an active lifestyle while encouraging resilience and sportsmanship amongst students. Separately, students have also learnt bowling, golfing and in-line skating. Students explore and discover the arts too, through mid- and end-of-year activities like dance, learning to play percussion instruments, and more.

Each of these dynamic PHD activities aid students in their social and emotional development by encouraging them to continuously learn new skills, while becoming active contributors to learning through group interaction and teamwork.
