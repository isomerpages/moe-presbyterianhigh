# **Student Well-being Framework**

Conceptualized in 2019, PHS’ Student Well-being Framework lays out our school’s aims and practices in cultivating a culture of care founded on our belief that every student is valuable.

Our students get to participate in a range of holistic development programmes and have access to various support systems. At the core of our approach to student well-being is the desire for every student to be a happy student. As shown in the centre of the framework above, we believe this occurs when students feel safe, belonged and experience positive teacher-student relationships. 

  

Creating such a supportive environment is integral in developing our students’ confidence and resilience as they acquire life-skills and prepare themselves for the future.
