# **Full Subject-Based Banding**

Presbyterian High School is one of 30+ secondary schools which will implement Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2023.

**Purpose of Full SBB**  
Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.

By 2024, secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:

*   Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2

Mixed form classes present more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.<br><br>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.<br><br>These subjects are:<br><br>•   Art<br>•   Character and Citizenship Education<br>•   Design and Technology<br>•   Food and Consumer Education<br>•   Music<br>•   Physical Education<br><br>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.<br><br><br>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will continue to be offered at Express Level, N(A) Level, and N(T) Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students’ PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.</td></tr><tr><td style="border-color:#002d13;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal">Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">•    Express Geography, History or Literature for 2NA</span><br><br><span style="font-weight:bold"> •    NA Geography or History for 2NT</span></td><td style="border-color:#002d13;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal">Currently, secondary school students can offer <span style="font-weight:bold">English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</span> at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students’ PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject.
