<p>Under the banner of the PresHigh GO! (Global Orientation) Beyond Borders
Programme, PresHighians explore the world through a range of internationalisation
experiences that develop Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC).</p>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>In line with our school’s vision of nurturing Passionate Learners, Servant
Leaders and Stewards of Tomorrow, PresHigh GO! seeks to broaden students’
horizons through authentic global experiences. By engaging with diverse
cultures and communities beyond Singapore, students develop Civic, Global
and Cross-Cultural Literacy – key Emerging 21st Century Competencies that
empower them to learn with curiosity, lead with empathy and contribute
responsibly in an interconnected world.</p>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>Service learning trips to Cambodia and Malacca foster empathy, teamwork
and cross-cultural understanding, while visits to places like Jeju, South
Korea broaden our students’ perspectives of their academic subjects in
authentic, real world contexts.
<br>
<br>In addition, local and virtual exchanges with partner schools in China
and Japan further strengthen intercultural connections. Together, these
experiences nurture PresHighians’ passion for learning and empower them
to be engaged and empathetic citizens of the world.</p>
