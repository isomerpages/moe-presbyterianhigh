On 14 April 2021, PHS commemorated the NRIC Ceremony for the Secondary 3 students. 

The NRIC Ceremony was held in the classrooms with our Principal, Mr. Owyong sharing about the significance of the ceremony and what it means to be a Singaporean. This sharing was followed by the presentation of the NRICs by the school’s Key Personnel (KPs) to each student. 

Students were also briefed about the Dos and Don’ts when using their NRICs.
