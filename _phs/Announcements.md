### Visiting The School On The Eve Of Teachers’ Day

2022-08-30

Greetings from Preshigh!

We have received requests from some of you enquiring whether you could visit the teachers on the eve of Teachers’ Day on 1 Sep 2022.  
Please note that the teachers will be engaged in the Teachers’ Day Celebrations, and they will report off duty after the student dismissal at 10.30 am on that day. Hence, please make personal arrangements with them if you intend to visit them in school to express your gratitude and appreciation. For security reasons, visitors will only be allowed into the school premises from 10.45 am.

Should you visit the school, please come in your current school uniform or smart causal attire with covered shoes. After registration at the guardroom, please proceed and gather at the canteen. Your teachers will be meeting you there. Please avoid crowding outside the General Office and staffrooms.

We seek your cooperation on this matter.

In partnership with you,  
Mrs Angeline Chan  
Principal
