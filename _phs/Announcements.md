### Visiting The School On The Eve Of Teachers’ Day

2022-08-30

Greetings from Preshigh!

We have received requests from some of you enquiring whether you could visit the teachers on the eve of Teachers’ Day on 1 Sep 2022.  
Please note that the teachers will be engaged in the Teachers’ Day Celebrations, and they will report off duty after the student dismissal at 10.30 am on that day. Hence, please make personal arrangements with them if you intend to visit them in school to express your gratitude and appreciation. For security reasons, visitors will only be allowed into the school premises from 10.45 am.

Should you visit the school, please come in your current school uniform or smart causal attire with covered shoes. After registration at the guardroom, please proceed and gather at the canteen. Your teachers will be meeting you there. Please avoid crowding outside the General Office and staffrooms.

We seek your cooperation on this matter.

In partnership with you,  
Mrs Angeline Chan  
Principal

### 2022 Online purchase of textbooks and uniform

2021-11-14

Dear Parents and Guardians,

In light of the COVID-19 situation, school has reviewed and streamlined the purchase of textbooks/uniforms to shorten the duration and number of parents/guardians that need to be in school.  The reduction in human traffic is part of the safe management measures in school.

Please refer to the school website for the instruction sheet, the book lists and user guides for online purchase of textbooks and uniforms.

**Online Purchase**: The bookshop and uniform vendors have upgraded their online portals.  Parents/Guardians are strongly encouraged to place your orders online.

**Onsite Purchase for Bookshop**: All collections or onsite purchases from the school bookshop will be strictly based on the scheduled appointment with the school bookshop.  Please make an appointment through the bookshop’s website.

We seek your understanding and cooperation to follow the instructions to keep our students and staff safe.

Thank you for your partnership and support.
