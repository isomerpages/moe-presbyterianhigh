# **Peer Support Leaders Appointment Ceremony**

In tandem with the school’s culture of care, the inaugural Peer Support Leaders Appointment Ceremony was held on 16 July 2021. Peer Support Leaders play an active role in supporting and looking out for their peers both emotionally and socially. We hope that this peer support culture will involve students in building an inclusive school.

 “I am honoured to be appointed as a Peer Support Leader. Being a Peer Support Leader enables me to lend some help to my peers by using skills that I have learned. Apart from that, I also hope to offer a listening ear when they need someone to hear them out. I will serve as a Peer Support Leader to the very best of my ability and be a positive influence to my peers.” 

Sue Yong Ling – 2 Compassion

  

“I decided to take up the role of a Peer Support Leader because I wanted to help my classmates when they are in need of a listening ear. At the same time, I can make new friends through the process and get to know my classmates better. I feel that my classmates may be more willing to share their feelings and thoughts with their peers. Therefore, I look forward to offering my assistance and support to the best of my ability to fulfil my role as a Peer Support Leader. Lastly, I would like to remind my classmates and schoolmates that everyone can play a part in helping those in need as ‘A friend in need is a friend indeed.’”

“I am firstly surprised to have been offered the role of a Peer Support Leader. I rarely take up leadership positions but this time, I am glad I have an opportunity to do so. I have always been keen on encouraging and helping my peers, especially since I have a huge interest in social work and serving the community. With the national examinations round the corner, I hope to boost my peers’ confidence prior to the examinations.”
