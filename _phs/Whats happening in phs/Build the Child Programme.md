# **Build the Child Programme**

The Build the Child Programme (BTC) was customised for all students when the new academic year started on 4 January. The programme focused on 4 domains: Teacher-Student Relationship, Discipline, School Values, as well as the PHS Teaching and Learning Framework.  

The secondary two students revisited the schoolâ€™s Mission, Vision and Values, while the upper secondary cohort participated in activities focusing on resilience and empathy.

All students also completed Teaching and Learning modules aimed at developing in students the intrinsic motivation to learn, self-directedness, and 21st\-century competencies.
