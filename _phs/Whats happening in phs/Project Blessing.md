# **Project Blessing**

Project Blessing is Presbyterian High School’s signature programme for the graduating students to give back to the community during the Chinese New Year period. This year, Project Blessing had been transformed to adapt to the COVID-19 situation. Instead of distributing goodie bags to the residents in our neighbourhood, each class ‘adopted’ a charitable organisation within our community and prepared customised hampers and gifts for their selected organisations.
