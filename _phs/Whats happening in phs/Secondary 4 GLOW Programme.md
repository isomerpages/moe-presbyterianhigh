# **Secondary 4 GLOW Programme**
  
On 8 and 9 March 2021, our graduating cohort underwent the **GLOW** programme customized by the school. They attended a study skills session on the proper methodology of Mind Mapping. Another aspect of **GLOW** was the team-building activities. 

Group activities such as archery, painting and catapult building facilitated and fostered better peer relations. It was a day of fun and learning!
