**'O'-Level Featured Article**


For most of us, making plans for the week or year is the most we think of. Lin Jun Quan has a different perspective. He has planned his route to becoming an architect.  He wishes to study Architecture in Polytechnic before getting a degree in the National University of Singapore followed by a Masters in Architecture in Cambridge.

But Jun Quan knows that success does not come to those who build castles in the air.  He shared with us his strategy for overcoming his difficulties in memorising key content by putting aside small amounts of time each day towards memorisation so that his mind would not be overwhelmed.

Jun Quan saw his hard work pay off, as consistent revision for each subject brought positive results during his preliminary examinations.

However, tragedy struck as Jun Quan’s mother was hospitalised during his ‘O’ Levels.  During this time, Jun Quan not only had to take care of himself and his studies, he also had to help with the everyday household chores in his mother’s absence.  He recalls gratefully how his parents and sister supported him during this difficult time.  He also thanks his subject teachers and form teachers who guided him through secondary school.

A firm believer in working and playing hard, Jun Quan set aside time for his beloved CCA, the PHS Drama Club. Through the Drama Club, Jun Quan learned how to face his fears, overcome performance anxiety and be resourceful.

Jun Quan laughs, “We had to innovate with the given resources to create props for ourselves.”

Jun Quan was not just a hard worker and motivated student, he believes that developing a sense of empathy was more important than finding personal success. “I still believe the most important value out of the five PHS school values is Empathy.  It helped me to understand my friends, and taught me how to share my views with them and support them on their way.”

Jun Quan’s advice to his juniors is to split their time wisely between work and play.  A healthy balance is needed for success.  Nicholas had this to say, “Cut out pointless activities.  Work hard and play hard.”
