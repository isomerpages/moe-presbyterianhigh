<h3><strong>STEM</strong></h3>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Igniting Minds@PresHigh, seeks to
broaden our studentsâ€™ exposure to Science, Technology, Engineering &amp;
Mathematics (STEM) through Health and Food Science to promote sustainable
lifestyles. We leverage our ALP to inspire our students on the beauty of
discovery and innovation. We aim to raise the aspirations of our students
to pursue STEM-related courses and careers to address the challenges of
our future.</p>
<p>Through our ALP, students will be exposed to emerging technologies (e.g.
Artificial intelligence) and harness technology to solve real-world problems
related to the Health and Food Science industry. Students will also get
to develop computational thinking skills through coding with micro:bit.
They will apply the design thinking process and use their computational
thinking skills to ideate and design prototypes to solve real-world problems.</p>
