<h4><strong>DSA STEM</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>(Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION (DSA) EXERCISE 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Igniting Minds @ PresHigh, seeks
to broaden our students’ exposure to Science, Technology, Engineering &amp;
Mathematics (STEM) through Health and Food Science to promote sustainable
lifestyles. We leverage our ALP to inspire our students on the beauty of
discovery and innovation. We aim to raise the aspirations of our students
to pursue STEM-related courses and careers to address the challenges of
our future. Through our ALP, students will be exposed to emerging technologies
(e.g. Artificial intelligence) and harness technology to solve real-world
problems related to the Health and Food Science industry. Students will
also get to develop computational thinking skills through coding with micro:bit.
They will apply the design thinking process and use their computational
thinking skills to ideate and design prototypes to solve real-world problems.</p>
