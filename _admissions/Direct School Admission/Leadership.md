<p><strong>DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION (DSA) EXERCISE 2024</strong>

also learn about the Design Thinking process through the planning of Values-In-Action
(VIA) projects.</p>
<p>The school’s Character First and Student Leadership Development Programmes
also seek to develop the potential of every student to build character,
hone leadership, and strengthen a heart for service.&nbsp; Various student

their community.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
