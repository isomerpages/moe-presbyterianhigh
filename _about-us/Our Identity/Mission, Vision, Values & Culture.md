<h3>Biblical Heritage</h3>
<p>Our biblical heritage reminds us of God's faithfulness to all generations
of staff and students of PHS. Today, in a volatile and complex world, our
biblical heritage anchors us in God, connects us to the Presbyterian community,
and affirms our role as a mission school, with humble beginnings as a rural
Chinese school. Inspired by our heritage, we will continue to place our
hope in God, confident that He will strengthen us, and serve our neighbours
with love.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>焚而不毁 (fén ér bù huǐ)</strong>
</p>
<p>Exodus 3:1-12</p>
<p>Like the burning bush that was not consumed, we stand firm in God’s faithfulness
and presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>我们屹立在神的信实和同在中</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>犹如燃烧的荆棘不会被火烧毁</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>饮水思源 (yǐn shuǐ sī yuán)</strong>
</p>
<p>Luke 17:11-17</p>
<p>Just as water gives life, we remember that God is our Creator and the
source of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>我们紧记神是造物主生命源头</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>犹如滋养生物延续生命的泉源</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>立己立人 (lì jǐ lì rén)</strong>
</p>
<p>Luke 2:41-52</p>
<p>Just as God first loved us, we strive to grow and mature in Christ to
love others in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>我们立志基督里成长爱神爱人</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>犹如神先爱了我们为我们舍命</strong>
</p>
