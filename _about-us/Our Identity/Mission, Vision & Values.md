<h3>SCHOOL MOTTO</h3>
<p>The Burning Bush with the school motto, ‘Aflame for Truth’, is inspired
by Exodus 3:1-12.&nbsp; The school is a place where students are taught
the importance of integrity and upholding the truth in thought, word and
deed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Burning Bush and school motto therefore remind us of God’s presence
and faithfulness, and that we are part of the community of Christians in
Presbyterian Churches all over the world.&nbsp; They encourage us to be
honest and upright, and to exemplify the school values with God as our
Creator and Guide.&nbsp;</p>
