<h3>SCHOOL MOTTO</h3>
<p>The Burning Bush with the school motto, ‘Aflame for Truth’, is inspired
by Exodus 3:1-12.&nbsp; The school is a place where students are taught
the importance of integrity and upholding the truth in thought, word and
deed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Burning Bush and school motto therefore remind us of God’s presence
and faithfulness, and that we are part of the community of Christians in
Presbyterian Churches all over the world.&nbsp; It encourages us to be
honest and upright, and to exemplify the school values with God as our
Creator and Guide.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3>Biblical Heritage</h3>
<p>Our biblical heritage reminds us of God's faithfulness to all generations
of staff and students of PHS. Today, in a volatile and complex world, our
biblical heritage anchors us in God, connects us to the Presbyterian community,
and affirms our role as a mission school, with humble beginnings as a rural
Chinese school. Inspired by our heritage, we will continue to place our
hope in God, confident that He will strengthen us, and serve our neighbours
with love.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>焚而不毁 (fén ér bù huǐ)</strong>
</p>
<p>Exodus 3:1-12</p>
<p>Like the burning bush that was not consumed, we stand firm in God’s faithfulness
and presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>饮水思源 (yǐn shuǐ sī yuán)</strong>
</p>
<p>Luke 17:11-17</p>
<p>Just as water gives life, we remember that God is our Creator and the
source of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>立己立人 (lì jǐ lì rén)</strong>
</p>
<p>Luke 2:41-52</p>
<p>Just as God first loved us, we strive to grow and mature in Christ to
love others in the same way.</p>
