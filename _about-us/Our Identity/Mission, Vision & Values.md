<p>The school motto, “Aflame for Truth”, teaches us to be resilient and to
uphold our corporate belief and integrity in adversity.</p>

actively contribute to society.</p>
<p><strong>立己立人 (lì jǐ lì rén)<br>这是校歌当中的一句，教导我们培养良好品德，立志成就自我，再感染他人向善。我们应先尽本分，再服务他人，建设社会。</strong>

ourselves, while serving others and the community.</p>
