**焚而不毁 (fén ér bù huǐ)**<br>
<b>这是本校校训，指的是在困难面前持守信念，坚忍不移的韧性。 </b>

The school motto, “Aflame for Truth”, teaches us to be resilient and to uphold our corporate belief and integrity in adversity.

<b>饮水思源 (yǐn shuǐ sī yuán)<br>
对国家、学校、家庭心怀感恩，懂得敬老尊贤，有责任心，积极回馈社会。</b>

We should be grateful and respectful to our parents, teachers, school and nation. We are responsible and accountable for our actions and should actively contribute to society.
  
<b>立己立人 (lì jǐ lì rén)  
这是校歌当中的一句，教导我们培养良好品德，立志成就自我，再感染他人向善。我们应先尽本分，再服务他人，建设社会。</b>

We build our character and inspire others to exemplify goodness. We develop ourselves, while serving others and the community. 


<b>School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos</b>
The school provides a Christian environment where there is a strong culture of Teamwork, Excellence, Affirmation and Mission-mindedness (TEAM PHS). To develop our students to be Passionate Learners, Servant Leaders and Stewards of Tomorrow, the school places emphasis on nurturing and developing good character as well as harnessing the leadership potential in every child, inculcating in students a sense of gratitude and responsibility to the community and nation. Providing a holistic education, the school seeks to enable our students to discover and grow in their strengths and talents to fulfil their potential.
