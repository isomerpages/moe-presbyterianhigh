<p>The school crest features two waves at the top, symbolising the continuous
growth and development of our school, from its origins as Li Sun High School
to its present identity as Presbyterian High School.</p>
<p>At the centre of the crest is the Burning Bush, a symbol of Presbyterian
Churches worldwide, accompanied by the Latin motto 'Nec Tamen Consumebatur',
which means ‘Yet it was not consumed’.&nbsp; From these Presbyterian roots,
we adopted our school motto, Aflame for Truth, which aligns with our school's
vision, mission and values.</p>
<p>The cross on the crest represents our faith in God, while the dove carrying
an olive branch symbolises the fulfilment of God’s promises. The book signifies
our commitment to learning and growth.</p>
<p>The background of the crest displays our school colours, white and blue:
white symbolises the quest for truth, while blue represents the pursuit
of excellence.</p>

<p>Exodus 3:1-12 recounts God's revelation to Moses at the burning bush.
This biblical account inspires our school motto, 'Aflame for Truth'. Together
with the emblem of the Burning Bush, which is the symbol of Presbyterian
Churches in Singapore, it serves as a reminder of God's presence and faithfulness
in our lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both the school motto and the emblem inspire us to uphold integrity and
truth in thought, word and deed. They also connect us to Christians in
Presbyterian Churches all over the world. As members of this global community,
we are called to exemplify our school values, with God as our Creator and
Guide.</p>
