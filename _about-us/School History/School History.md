_Not by Might, not by power but by my Spirit says the Lord – School Ethos_

_In 1947, the Presbyterian Synod mooted the idea of starting a Christian secondary school to provide education for students.  Despite the Synod’s enthusiasm for the idea, there was no land to build the school and no funds to draw on. However, the vision of a school, rooted in Christian values, and one that provided good education was imprinted in the hearts of the Synod members. This vision gave them the motivation to soldier on after many failed attempts at realising the school over the course of 18 years. Finally, in God’s good time, the efforts of the Synod started to bear fruit, and things started to fall in place._



_Presbyterian High School would not have come into being if not for the dogged determination and faith of our founding father, Reverend Lee Huai Kwang. <img src="/images/history-1.jpg" style="width:300px;height:180px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Reverend Lee firmly believed in the mission of education as a service to society. More importantly, he was convicted of the role mission schools play in inculcating students with Christian values._




_Reverend Lee was the pastor of Bethel Presbyterian Church and principal of Ming Sin Primary School in 1961. <img src="/images/3a.png" style="width:220px;height:180px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> His faith moved him to propose loaning the premises of Ming Sin Primary School to start Li Sun High School.  At his word, Li Sun High School was founded and it opened its doors to the first batch of 150 students at its Jalan Lateh campus off Upper Serangoon Road in 1965. This was a milestone in the history of the school. Yet, it was only the beginning of an obstacles-filled journey of school building and development – one that bore testament to God’s providence, handiwork and steadfastness over the school._
