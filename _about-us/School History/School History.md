_Not by Might, not by power but by my Spirit says the Lord – School Ethos_

_In 1947, the Presbyterian Synod mooted the idea of starting a Christian secondary school to provide education for students.  Despite the Synod’s enthusiasm for the idea, there was no land to build the school and no funds to draw on. However, the vision of a school, rooted in Christian values, and one that provided good education was imprinted in the hearts of the Synod members. This vision gave them the motivation to soldier on after many failed attempts at realising the school over the course of 18 years. Finally, in God’s good time, the efforts of the Synod started to bear fruit, and things started to fall in place._
