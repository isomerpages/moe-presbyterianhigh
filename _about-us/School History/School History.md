_Not by Might, not by power but by my Spirit says the Lord – School Ethos_

_In 1947, the Presbyterian Synod mooted the idea of starting a Christian secondary school to provide education for students.  Despite the Synod’s enthusiasm for the idea, there was no land to build the school and no funds to draw on. However, the vision of a school, rooted in Christian values, and one that provided good education was imprinted in the hearts of the Synod members. This vision gave them the motivation to soldier on after many failed attempts at realising the school over the course of 18 years. Finally, in God’s good time, the efforts of the Synod started to bear fruit, and things started to fall in place._



_Presbyterian High School would not have come into being if not for the dogged determination and faith of our founding father, Reverend Lee Huai Kwang. <img src="/images/history-1.jpg" style="width:300px;height:180px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Reverend Lee firmly believed in the mission of education as a service to society. More importantly, he was convicted of the role mission schools play in inculcating students with Christian values._




_Reverend Lee was the pastor of Bethel Presbyterian Church and principal of Ming Sin Primary School in 1961. <img src="/images/3a.png" style="width:220px;height:180px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> His faith moved him to propose loaning the premises of Ming Sin Primary School to start Li Sun High School.  At his word, Li Sun High School was founded and it opened its doors to the first batch of 150 students at its Jalan Lateh campus off Upper Serangoon Road in 1965. This was a milestone in the history of the school. Yet, it was only the beginning of an obstacles-filled journey of school building and development – one that bore testament to God’s providence, handiwork and steadfastness over the school._

Moore Anderson, a missionary who had dedicated his life to church planting and school building in Asia. “Li Sun” was derived from the translation of Reverend Alan S. Moore Anderson’s Mandarin name, An Li Sun ( 安礼逊 ).</td></tr></thead></table>


Mr Chou Chu Shen, Li Sun High School’s first principal, led the school for 12 years. Faced with limited facilities at the premises of Ming Sin Primary School’s campus, Mr Chou and his team went the extra mile to ensure that despite the limited resources, students were still given opportunities to develop holistically. Mr Lim Lak Ching took over as principal of the school after Mr Chou retired in 1977. However, in 1978, Mr Lim was posted overseas, and Mr Chen Ying Foo, a teacher at the school, took over the duties of leading the school as acting principal from April 1978 to the end of 1979. In July 1980, the Ministry of Education (MOE) proposed that Li Sun High School should either have development plans to set up an secondary school with its own campus or close the school. Reverend Lee, who was the Chairperson of the School Management Board at that time, worked tirelessly with the church and made several attempts to secure a campus for the school, but to no avail. However, he was very sure of one thing – Li Sun High School must go on. He had great faith in God’s timely providence and his prayer was answered in August 1980, when MOE offered the school a plot of land in Ang Mo Kio for campus building. While leading the team to oversee campus building, Reverend Lee also engaged in discussions with the school redevelopment committee to re-think the school’s name. The school was named Li Sun High School to reflect the bearing of Chinese-medium education in post-war Singapore. Given the changing educational landscape and English being officially recognised as the medium of instruction, the committee proposed that the name of the school be changed to “Presbyterian High School”. Besides clearly reflecting the Christian mission of the school, the proposed name also reflected the intent of the school moving ahead with times to embrace English-medium education. In 1981, the Presbyterian Synod officially endorsed the new school campus site at Ang Mo Kio, and officially renamed it “Presbyterian High School”. In 1983, the long-awaited and momentous move to enter the ‘Promised Land’ finally took place. 23 classes comprising 645 students and 37 teachers began their new school year at the brand new school building sitting on a 1.96-hectare plot of land along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6. At that time, the school co-located with Li Hua Primary School and Ang Mo Kio North Primary School.

Rather, she was born into a poor family as a sickly infant, whose survival was made possible only by utmost care and repeated resuscitations. The efforts of the pioneers must not be forgotten.” (Mr Lian Sek Lin, PHS 50 th Anniversary Commemorative Publication – 50 Years of God's Providence, Handiwork and Steadfastness)</td></tr></thead></table>
