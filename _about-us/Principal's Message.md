Presbyterian High School (PHS) has a rich history and heritage. When the school opened her doors in 1965 as a Chinese medium school, Li Sun High (礼逊中学), as it was then called, shared premises with Ming Sin Primary School at Upper Serangoon Road and was home to only 150 students. Moving in tandem with our nation’s growth and development, the school adopted English as the medium of instruction and was renamed Presbyterian High School in 1983. PHS is now a sprawling campus standing on 3 hectares of land in Ang Mo Kio and home to over 1,200 students and staff. With her clock tower and the declaration, “To God Be The Glory”, on her main building, the campus stands out as a striking landmark in Ang Mo Kio and is a choice school for many. 

As a mission school set up by the Presbyterian Synod, character development is at the heart of what we do. We believe every member of the school has been placed in PHS by God. Supported by a strong culture of Teamwork, Excellence, Affirmation and Mission-mindedness (TEAM PHS), we place emphasis on nurturing and developing good character in our students and inculcating in them a sense of gratitude and responsibility to the community and nation.

Through our distinctive programmes, the school seeks to enable our students to discover and grow in their God-given strengths and talents to fulfil their potential. The school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Community Youth Leadership (CYL) is premised on servant leadership and is focused on providing students with opportunities to be leaders of empathy as they lead in serving the community with a purpose. The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Health Science seeks to excite students in the learning of STEM and enable students to apply their knowledge and skills to solve meaningful problems.

We stand on the shoulders of giants who have left us a legacy of faith and trust in God. We continue to look to God to reveal His greatness to PHS and empower us to nurture and guide our students to lead purposeful lives beyond our school gates. To God be the glory always!

Aflame for Truth,
Mrs Angeline Chan
