<p>Welcome to Presbyterian High School (PHS)! It is with gratitude and a
strong sense of stewardship that I assume the role of Principal at this
meaningful moment in our school's journey. As a mission school established
by the Presbyterian Synod, we have just celebrated a remarkable 60 years
of faith, dedication and service. I would like to express my appreciation
to Mrs Angeline Chan, who led with conviction, grace and courage, and laid
strong foundations for the school's continued growth. Today, PHS is a school
of choice for many families and home to over 1,100 students and staff.
Our iconic clock tower and the declaration "To God Be The Glory" on our
main building stand as enduring testaments to God's faithfulness across
generations.</p>
<p>As a mission school, we believe every member of our community has been
placed in PHS by God, and our students are at the heart of all we do. We
are committed to sustaining a strong culture of Teamwork, Excellence, Affirmation
and Mission-mindedness (TEAM PHS), where every student is known, valued
and encouraged to develop their God-given talents. Alongside academic rigour,
we place strong emphasis on character development, well-being and the cultivation
of purpose. We want our students to grow into young adults anchored by
a strong moral compass, who seek to serve others and contribute meaningfully
to society.</p>
<p>To prepare students for a rapidly changing future, we focus on developing
21st century competencies they will need to thrive in tomorrow's world.
Our Applied Learning Programme in STEM equips students with digital and
technological skills, including Artificial Intelligence and design thinking,
which they apply to solve real-world challenges in areas like food sustainability
and health innovation. Our Learning for Life Programme in Community Youth
Leadership gives students opportunities to develop as leaders and engage
with the community, helping them learn to serve others with empathy and
purpose.</p>
<p>Education is a shared endeavour. I am deeply thankful for the dedication
and professionalism of our teachers and staff, whose commitment and care
shape the daily experiences of our students. I value the strong partnerships
with the School Management Committee, parents, alumni and the wider community,
who have been integral to our school's growth.</p>
<p>As PHS moves beyond its 60th year, we reflect with gratitude on the legacy
of those who have built and strengthened this institution. Their faithful
service and vision have shaped PHS into a community that values character,
learning and service. I look forward to working closely with all stakeholders
as we build on these firm foundations whilst thoughtfully embracing change
and innovation. May PHS continue to be a place where values are lived out,
learning is purposeful, and every student is empowered to make a positive
difference in the world.</p>
<p>Aflame for Truth,</p>
