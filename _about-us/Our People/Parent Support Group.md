<h2>Parent Support Group</h2>

Our Parent Support Group (PSG) is a dynamic community of parents that collaborates with the school to strengthen programmes and support fellow parents on their parenting journey. They take pride in ensuring that every child in PHS feels cared for, and they generously offer their time, talents and insights to create a safe and conducive learning environment for all children in the school. Many parents of our alumni, who have experienced the positive impact of PSG, choose to remain involved and share their journey with the PSG. 

<h4>Recess Drop-in Programme</h4>
Fully run by our PSG, the school’s recess drop-in programmes provide an avenue for students to unwind and be cared for by significant adults. 

Art Jam, which operates every Monday and Wednesday, allows students to unwind and express their creativity and emotions through art. Games are also available at the Ohana Room. Students can play board games for leisure or engage in a friendly competition with their schoolmates.

<h4>ParentsHugS</h4>
To promote students’ well-being, PSG members lovingly pack goodie bags and distribute them to the entire school every term.
