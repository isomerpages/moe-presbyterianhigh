Message by Chairman, School Management Board

“I would rather walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light.” (Helen Keller).

Helen Keller, the first deaf and blind person who graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Harvard University in 1904, was quoted to have said: “I would rather walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light.” This friend she was referring to may have been her long-time friend and teacher Anne Sullivan, who was herself visually impaired and who had taught Helen Keller how to read, write and communicate verbally. With the strong friendship and support from Anne Sullivan, Helen Keller eventually became a world famous speaker and author, often advocating for people with disabilities, women, and the working-class.

The school environment is the best place for each student to make a decision to become a positive influence on another friend. Are you willing to be the friend who would walk alongside another even as the latter is going through challenging times? As we come to the end of another academic year, we hope that all students at Presbyterian High School have availed themselves of the opportunities to reach out and form friendships with one another - not just with fellow classmates within the class but also with schoolmates from different levels and different CCAs. Through these friendships, we can learn different things from each other; we can practise how to support each other in various circumstances. We can help each other to grow and develop to become Promise Keepers, Hope Builders and Servant Leaders for our community.

The Bible teaches us that having good friends is important. The following verses are just a few among many that teach us about friendship:

Proverbs 18:24 -- A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

Proverbs 13:20 -- He who walks with the wise grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm.

Ecclesiastes 4:9–10 -- Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labour: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.

John 15:13 -- Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.

Jesus is the greatest example of a good friend. He demonstrated sacrificial friendship and love for us when he died on the cross for us. Jesus took the initiative to reach out to those who are around him even when it was not convenient or expected of him to do so.

As we look through the pages of this year’s school magazine and see all the different people pictured here, let us learn from Jesus and see how we can continue to take the initiative to reach out to a fellow schoolmate, encourage each other, and build strong, good friendships that will last a lifetime.

“Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.” (1 Thessalonian 5:11).
