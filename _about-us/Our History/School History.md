<p>Presbyterian High School (PHS) began humbly as a rural Chinese school
with no campus to call her own during the post-war years when Chinese-medium
secondary schools were in shortage. At the Annual General Meeting of the
Presbyterian Synod in 1961, Bethel Presbyterian Church stepped up to loan
the premises of its subsidiary school, Ming Sin School, to the new secondary
school, Li Sun High School, which the Synod was setting up. Rev Lee Huai
Kwang, a pastor with a deep conviction for mission schools, became one
of the pioneers who played a formative role in the birth and growth of
Li Sun High School.</p>

<p>Located at Jalan Lateh off Upper Serangoon Road, Li Sun High School received
its first batch of students on 4 January 1965. “Li Sun” was derived from
the translation of Rev Alan S. Moore Anderson’s name in Mandarin, An Li
Sun (安礼逊). Rev Anderson was a missionary and champion of education who
dedicated his life to building churches and schools in China and Malaya.</p>

<p>In July 1980, the Ministry of Education (MOE) proposed two options for
the school: either to create plans for establishing an independent secondary
school with its own campus, or to close down. The Board was resolved to
preserve the school. When MOE met with the school in August 1980, it offered
a plot of land in Ang Mo Kio for campus building. On top of that, MOE was
also prepared to bear half of the development costs. In 1981, the Presbyterian
Synod officially endorsed the new site of the school at Ang Mo Kio and
renamed it “Presbyterian High School”. This is because they hoped that
the change of name would convey the school’s Christian mission and her
intent to align with the national initiative of using English as the medium
of instruction.</p>

<p>Today, the campus, which was re-developed in the 1990s, features beautifully
designed blocks, a prominent clock tower, and above all, a declaration
on its main building, “To God Be The Glory”. It stands as a striking landmark
in Ang Mo Kio. As a mission school supported by two anchor churches, Ang
Mo Kio and True Grace Presbyterian Churches, PHS places emphasis on nurturing
and developing good character in her students, inculcating in them a sense
of gratitude and responsibility to the community and nation.</p>
