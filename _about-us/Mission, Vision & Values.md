### SCHOOL MOTTO

Aflame For Truth

<i>The Burning Bush is a symbol of the community of Christians in Presbyterian Churches all over the world. In the Book of Exodus in the Bible, we are told that Moses discovered just such a bush in a very deserted place. It stopped Moses in his track – so amazing it was.  </i>
  
God was showing something of His Holiness, greatness and power to Moses, and was calling him to live for God, doing what He says.  
  
Therefore when we see this symbol on our flag, we should DRAW NEAR to God with wonder and praise. And when we draw near to God we should, like Moses, LISTEN WISELY to what God says. Having learned what God say to us, we should DO WELL what HE demands.  
  
If then GOD shows Himself and His way to us, He will surely make us AFLAME FOR TRUTH.  
_Rev John Hanna_
