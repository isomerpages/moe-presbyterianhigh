<h4>Learning for Life Programme: Community Youth Leadership</h4>


<h5>Our Programme</h5>
 
The school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Community Youth Leadership (CYL) is anchored on Robert Greenleaf’s Servant Leadership philosophy. It aims to develop and empower PresHighians to become empathetic servant leaders who serve the community with a clear sense of purpose.

<h5>Our Approach</h5>
<ul>
	<li><b>Tier 1</b><br>Aligned with Robert Greenleaf’s Servant Leadership philosophy, all Secondary 1 and 2 students participate in customised LLP modules during curriculum time. Designed around thematic foci such as the elderly, inclusiveness and environmental sustainability, all Secondary 1 to 3 students are guided to plan and implement meaningful class projects that help to raise awareness of issues and make a positive impact on the community.</li>

<li><b>Tier 2</b><br>
To further develop students with the aptitude for and interest in leadership, Community Youth Leaders and Peer Support Leaders are appointed from within the student body to lead in the organisation of school events that serve both the school and the wider community, such as the annual PHS Kindness Week and Chinese New Year LoHei with the elderly and foreign workers.<br><center>
