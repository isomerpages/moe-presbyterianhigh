<h4>Learning for Life Programme: Community Youth Leadership</h4>
<h5>Our Programme</h5>
<p>The school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Community Youth Leadership
(CYL) is anchored on Robert Greenleaf’s Servant Leadership philosophy.
It aims to develop and empower PresHighians to become empathetic servant
leaders who serve the community with a clear sense of purpose.</p>
<h5>Our Approach</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong>
<br>Aligned with Robert Greenleaf’s Servant Leadership philosophy, all Secondary
1 and 2 students participate in customised LLP modules during curriculum
time. Designed around thematic foci such as the elderly, inclusiveness
and environmental sustainability, all Secondary 1 to 3 students are guided
to plan and implement meaningful class projects that help to raise awareness
of issues and make a positive impact on the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong>
<br>To further develop students with the aptitude for and interest in leadership,
Community Youth Leaders and Peer Support Leaders are appointed from within
the student body to lead in the organisation of school events that serve
both the school and the wider community, such as the annual PHS Kindness
Week and Chinese New Year LoHei with the elderly and foreign workers.
