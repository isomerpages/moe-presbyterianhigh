<h3><strong>Learning for Life Programme: Community Youth Leadership Igniting Hearts@PresHigh</strong></h3>
<p>
<br><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) <em>– Igniting Hearts@PresHigh</em> aims
to nurture all PresHighians to be Servant Leaders who Serve with Empathy,
Lead with Humility, and Excel with Integrity.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s LLP Framework is anchored in The Leadership Challenge Model
(5 practices of exemplary leadership), and leverages the Design Thinking
process as a key pedagogy.&nbsp; Through nurturing them holistically through
the ‘Heads, Hearts and Hands’ approach, PresHighians are guided to learn
how to lead themselves, lead others, and make a difference in our community.</p>
