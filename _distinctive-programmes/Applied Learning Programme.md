<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme: STEM (Health &amp; Food Science)</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Igniting Minds@PresHigh</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) <em>– Igniting Minds@PresHigh</em>  <em>– </em>broadens
students’ horizons in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics
(STEM). Our programme aims to nurture all PresHighians to be Passionate
Learners and Stewards of Tomorrow in the fields of Health and Food Science.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Immerse</em></strong>
<br>Develop a deep knowledge in digital literacies and explore emerging technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
<p><strong><em>Ignite</em></strong>
<br>Cultivate a passion for STEM and be a changemaker to solve real-world
challenges</p>
<p><strong><em>Innovate</em></strong>
<br>Embrace a mindset of continuous learning and improvement, striving to
create human-centric solutions</p>
<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Programme for all PresHighians</strong>
<br>Our Tier 1 Programme focuses on developing computational thinking and
design thinking skills among all PresHighians, to solve future challenges
in Health and Food Sustainability.
<br>
<br>Aligned with the Healthier SG Initiative and Singapore Green Plan 2030,
students will apply coding through block-based programming and create innovative
prototypes to address these challenges. In the Lower Secondary ALP lessons,
students work collaboratively in teams to empathise with users, define
their problem, ideate solutions, and refine and test their prototypes to
address user needs.</p>
<p>Our Tier 1 programme will also integrate AI literacy into the curriculum.
Students will learn about the principles of AI, machine learning and the
ethical considerations of using AI. They will also be empowered with the
knowledge to use AI tools responsibly, as well as to critically evaluate
AI-generated information to make good discernment.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2</strong>: <strong>Interest-Based Programme</strong>
<br>Our Tier 2 programme develops students with a deeper interest in STEM
by providing rich opportunities for hands-on learning through workshops,
learning journeys and industry attachments. Students will explore topics
beyond the classroom, such as:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Drone Adventure with Python Programming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning Journey and attachment to A*STAR&nbsp; Genome Institute of Singapore
(GIS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3D printing workshops.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Through an active curation of external partnerships, our students get
to deepen their learning with Institutes of Higher Learning and other industry-leading
institutions. These experiences bridge classroom knowledge with real-world
applications, exposing students to emerging technologies and helping them
explore STEM-related<strong> </strong>careers.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 3: Talent Development Programme</strong>
<br>Our Tier 3 Programme aims to challenge and stretch students who have both
aptitude and passion for STEM. This tier provides students with opportunities
to participate in competitions, pursue self-initiated projects and take
on mentorship roles to guide and inspire juniors.
<br>
<br>Students in this tier will gain hands-on experience and deepen their skills
through STEM competitions such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Swift Explorers Singapore (Apple)
<br>- App Design Challenge
<br>- App Development Challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health &amp; Food Science Competition (STEM Inc)
<br>- S1 Cluster Design Innovation Challenge
<br>- National Youth AI Prompt Challenge</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Our tiered developmental approach seeks to encourage all PresHighians
to hone their digital competencies, harness emerging technologies in Health
&amp; Food Science, and become creative and collaborative Stewards of Tomorrow.</p>
