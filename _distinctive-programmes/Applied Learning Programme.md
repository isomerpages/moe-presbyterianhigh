<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme: STEM (Health &amp; Food Science)</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Igniting Minds@PresHigh</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) <em>– Igniting Minds@PresHigh</em>  <em>– </em>broadens
students’ horizons in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics
(STEM). Our programme aims to nurture all PresHighians to be <strong>Passionate Learners</strong> and <strong>Stewards of Tomorrow</strong> in
the fields of Health and Food Science.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Immerse</em></strong>
<br>Develop a deep knowledge in digital literacies and explore emerging technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p><strong><em>Ignite</em></strong>
<br>Cultivate a passion for STEM and be a changemaker to solve real-world
challenges.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innovate</em></strong>
<br>Embrace a mindset of continuous learning and improvement, striving to
create human-centric solutions.</p>
<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Programme for all PresHighians</strong>
<br>Our Tier 1 Programme focuses on developing <strong>computational thinking</strong> and <strong>design thinking skills</strong> among
all PresHighians, to solve future challenges in Health and Food Sustainability.
<br>
<br>Aligned with the <strong>Healthier SG Initiative</strong> and <strong>Singapore Green Plan 2030</strong>,
students will apply coding through <strong>block-based programming</strong> and
create innovative prototypes to address these challenges. In the Lower
Secondary ALP lessons, students work collaboratively in teams to empathise
with users, define their problem, ideate solutions, and refine and test
their prototypes to address user needs.</p>
<p>Our Tier 1 programme will also integrate <strong>AI literacy</strong> into
the curriculum. Students will learn about the principles of AI, machine
learning and the ethical considerations of using AI. They will also be
empowered with the knowledge to use AI tools responsibly, as well as to
critically evaluate AI-generated information to make good discernment.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2</strong>: <strong>Interest-Based Programme</strong>
<br>Our Tier 2 programme develops students with a deeper interest in STEM
by providing rich opportunities for hands-on learning through workshops,
learning journeys and industry attachments. Students will explore topics
beyond the classroom, such as:
<br>
<br>o&nbsp;Drone Adventure with Python Programming
<br>o&nbsp;Learning Journey and attachment to A*STAR&nbsp; Genome Institute
of Singapore (GIS)
<br>o&nbsp;3D printing workshops</p>
<p>Through an active curation of external partnerships, our students get
to deepen their learning with Institutes of Higher Learning and other industry-leading
institutions. These experiences bridge classroom knowledge with real-world
applications, exposing students to <strong>emerging technologies</strong> and
helping them explore <strong>STEM-related careers</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 3: Talent-Development Programme</strong>
<br>Our Tier 3 Programme aims to challenge and stretch students who have both
aptitude and passion for STEM. This tier provides students with opportunities
to participate in <strong>competitions</strong>, pursue <strong>self-initiated projects</strong> and
take on <strong>mentorship roles</strong> to guide and inspire juniors.
<br>
<br>Students in this tier will gain hands-on experience and deepen their skills
through STEM competitions such as:
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Swift Explorers Singapore (Apple)
<br>- App Design Challenge
<br>- App Development Challenge
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Health &amp; Food Science Competition (STEM Inc)
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; S1 Cluster Design Innovation Challenge
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; National Youth AI Prompt Challenge</p>
<p>Our tiered developmental approach seeks to encourage all PresHighians
to hone their digital competencies, harness emerging technologies in Health
&amp; Food Science, and become creative and collaborative Stewards of Tomorrow.</p>
