<h4>Our 60th Anniversary logo reflects the rich history of PHS. It marks this significant milestone with the numeral "60" in the school colours, white and blue, which symbolise our quest for truth and excellence. Our school name is presented in English as well as Chinese, paying tribute to our origins as a Chinese-medium school. Connecting us to Christians in Presbyterian Churches worldwide, the Burning Bush —  a symbol of Presbyterian Churches — affirms our shared heritage and faith. The gold dove, representing the Holy Spirit, highlights God’s enduring faithfulness to PHS, while the gold compass signifies our commitment to carry on our mission, with God as our Guide.</h4>
